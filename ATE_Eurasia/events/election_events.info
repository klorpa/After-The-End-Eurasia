INFO ABOUT THE ELECTION EVENTS
PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU EDIT AND REWRITE THIS FILE ACCORDINGLY
4000 - 4300: alternative voting periods, in accrodance to laws. If you're a defender war you refuse to hold those elections.
5000: fire the election events between federal and popular elections, seems like at the current iteration only popular is possible
5100s are Federal elections, i'm ignoring them because it seems like they can't get triggered. From quick glance idk how different they are from reular elections
5200s:Popular election
5200: First event, fires for the current heir. Fires event 5205 for all characters in the realm, and 5206 for all the provinces. fires 5210/5220 to show who won the elections
5205: voting as a character - characters vote according to who they like best.
5206: province "voting" - you get more votes the higher your MA(which i think is a leftover from COTC?), you get more votes the higer your piety, you get more votes the higer your diplo, and you lose votes for revolt risk.
HOW VOTING WORK:
The variable "victory_margin_popular" affects the election. A positive number represent a vote for the incumbent while a negative represents a vote for the challenger



INCUMBENT LOSES
5210: you lost the elections. fire 5211/5212 under some case relating to an MR? seems to be irrelevant.
5211: this seems to be some ping event
5212:???
5215: gain prestiege according to the tier
5216: notification event for liege and vassals about the new ruler 

INCUMBENT WINS
5220: you won the election
5225: informs the challenger that he lost
5226: ???


5500: clear up event

5250: pretty sure this can only be called via the console, it surpasses the watiing period so you don't have to wait when you test it
