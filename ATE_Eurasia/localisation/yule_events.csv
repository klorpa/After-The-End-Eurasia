EVTNAME_yule_1;Celebrating the Winter Solstice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_yule_1;It is that time of the year again! I have decided to celebrate Yule with some appreciated courtiers and dynasty members of mine. Together, we shall go on a walk in the woods and find the mightiest and most ancestral tree possible : that way only may we find a way to properly commemorate our ancesters' fates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yule_1;Let Yule begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_yule_2;After walking a few leagues, a majestuous oak tree appears before me. This seems to be the right place to enjoy our annual feast. We could of course continue our search, but it might be dangerous to adventure ourselves too deep into the forest...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yule_2;That tree will perfectly do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_yule_2;I am sure that we can find a better tree than this pathetic oak!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_yule_3;Before I even have the time to acknowledge it, a bear is charging at me, clearly willing to gore my sweet innocent soul. I barely have the time to decide how to react.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yule_3;Come at me you disgusting animal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_yule_3;I guess that my castle's walls made me feel too secure... Run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_yule_4;I have comissioned my cook for some special meals, and a various assortment of food is now standing in front of me. This consequent walk has made me feel hungry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yule_4;A few steam-cooked vegetables will do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_yule_4;This gravlax salmon has caught my attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_yule_4;There are no limits on Yule! Bring us the biggest piece of deer meat you have!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_yule_5;Our stomachs feel heavy and the alcohol starts to make us feel dizzy: it seems like the celebration is coming to an end. It will, however, be a Yule to remember for decades!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yule_5;A celebration to remember indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_yule_6;While the feast is about to begin, I suddendly hear loud screams : anxiou at first, I quickly realize it is an old man visibly heavily injured and confused. While very unclear, I understand he claims to have been attacked by a a band of robbers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_yule_6;Give this man a doctor, food and clothes : he shall join my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yule_6;If he approaches me I will make sure to retaliate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_yule_8;Everything has been organized to perfection, the guests are numerous and admirative of my generousity : Yule is about to properly begin !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yule_8;It's quite possible I might be already a bit tipsy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_yule_7;After walking for an addtional lead, a particular tree catches my attention : a beautiful old and venerabe holly, like I had never seen before. I was right to perseverate : it truly is the perfect tree for Yule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yule_7;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_yule_9;It has been quite a while since we first saw that oak tree and I have to admit that we haven't any better tree than the latter. I guess we should just stop right next to that birch tree before we get lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yule_9;We should have stopped next to that oak tree...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_yule_10;One of my courtiers indicates me that has found a nice fir tree a quarter of a lead away form where we are. That will probaly do, even if we could have found something more majestuous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yule_10;It is better than nothing I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
