EVTDESC_britain_100;It is certain that the sounding brass and thunderous voices of angels are heard in the heavens, for the long wait seems to have finally ended. There is a [Root.GetKingQueen] in Britain again. Great Britain and her people stand united in fact after many long centuries of petty feuding and interregnum. [Root.GetTitledName] has been recognized by Lord and Commoner both as bearing the divine majesty and worthiness of monarchy, 2500 years of British history have scarce seen such a glorious revolution! Now out of Westminster and London and over the rambling roads and numberless towns of Britain is heard that archaic psalmic cry, those words that crash and glitter like the waves of the sea or the swords of men upon steel: \n “God Save the [Root.GetKingQueen]!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_britain_100;Divinity doth hedge a [Root.GetKingQueen].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
