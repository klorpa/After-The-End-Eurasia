The silver-domed mosque of al-Aqsa was built by the noble caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab, whose successors have tirelessly expanded the magnificent complex that you behold. al-Quds in general is regarded often as the third most blessed city of all of Islam, and home to the Haram al-Sharif a raised platform that is revered by all people of the Book.

EVTDESC_hajj26;You have arrived in the city of al-Quds, home of the Haram esh-Sharif. But spending time in the city has been quite eye-opening. Here there are men of all sorts of different creeds. In your inn, the theological talkings of a Jewish rabbi and Christian theologian catches your ear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjtolerantalaqsa;The people of the book share the same God as us, no? Let us discuss...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjzealousalaqsa;If only they saw the only way to revere the Greatest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajj27;You have arrived in the city of al-Quds in all of its wonder. The marvelous hustle and bustle of the city is almost overwhelming, as men and women of every creed and color walk the streets around you.

EVTOPT_hajjpooralaqsa;Take this and go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjnopooralaqsa;I am nobility, you commoner swine! Unhand me at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hajjalaqsashrine; You have spent quite some time in The Holy City of many great prophets of the God Almighty, making small talk with local aristocracy, and the time has come for you to fulfill the purpose of this pilgrimage.

An old man in black robes greets you, his clothing the hallmark of the local mufti of al-Quds. He bows respectfully. "Come," ushering you to join him in the midday prayer. As I step through its hallowed doors, I enter the common praying area. All men are equal before God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjalaqsashrine1;I bow my head in prayer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajjalaqsahome;Walking back through the familiar gates of my castle, I can't help but feel fulfilled. I have travelled across the land, and returned a changed man. Before Allah, all men are indeed equal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hajj32;You have arrived in the city of Al Madinah in all of its wonder. The marvelous hustle and bustle of the city is almost overwhelming, as men and women of every creed and color walk the streets around you. Suddenly knocking you out of contemplation is the cry of a streetside vendor with a strong Ivri accent, a peculiar scroll in his hands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjpoetrycraftalbaqi;What a magnificent piece! How much does it cost?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjnopoetryalbaqi;The poets of my court can do better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajj33;You have arrived in the city of Al Madinah, City of the Prophet. As you approach the hallowed grounds, a bookish merchant glances up from behind a small stand. "Traveller! Come forth and browse my wares, the finest the old-world can offer." ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hajj34;You did not know quite what to expect when setting off on this grand journey, but stillness of Al-Baqi' was a certainly a surprise to you. It was no opulent display or mosque, simply a ground for where the dead now reside. Wandering through the markers said to be the final resting places of the Prophet's Family and Companions, I found myself contemplating the many great sacrifices of Muhammad (SAWS) surrounded by dozens of other pilgrims. As the world drifted further away a voice catches you from a distance. "You must be the [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]," it calls to me. "Tell me, how do your people of [Root.Capital.GetName] follow the example of Muhammad...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjhot;You answer to the best of your ability...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajjalbaqihome;Walking back through the familiar gates of my castle, I can't help but feel fulfilled. I have travelled across the land, and returned a changed man. Before Allah, all men are indeed equal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
