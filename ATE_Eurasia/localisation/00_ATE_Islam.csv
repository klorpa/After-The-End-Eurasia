EVTDESC_islamate32;With the core of the Islamic world firmly under your control, and the representatives of the various Sunni movements formed after the time of the Disaster at your table, you begin. You give a long argument why the world fell into the chaos it did - largely in part because there was no defender of the faith - and make a passionate plea that, together, the Sunni faithful would survive better than divided by innovations and beset by polytheists, idolaters, and those who do not worship God. Slowly, the council turns in your favor, the Grand Mufti nods in agreements first, and reccomends you take the mantle of Caliph. By the end of the meeting, a landmark event has happened, as most of the Sunni faithful now recognize the unity of the People of the Prophet's Tradition once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hajj26;You have arrived in the city of al-Quds, home of the Haram esh-Sharif. But spending time in the city has been quite eye-opening. Here there are men of all sorts of different creeds.

EVTOPT_hajjnopooralaqsa;I am nobility, you commoner swine! Unhand me at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_hajjnopoetryalbaqi;The poets of my court can do better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajj33;You have arrived in the city of Al Madinah, City of the Prophet. As you approach the hallowed grounds, a bookish merchant glances up from behind a small stand. "Traveller! Come forth and browse my wares, the finest the old-world can offer." ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Wandering through the markers said to be the final resting places of the Prophet's Family and Companions, I found myself contemplating the many great sacrifices of Muhammad (SAWS) surrounded by dozens of other pilgrims. As the world drifted further away a voice catches you from a distance. "You must be the [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]," it calls to me.

TXT_ashura_begins;You begin commemmorating Ashura.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_2;The anniversary of the first day of the battle in Karbala has arrived, and with it, mourners in black flock the streets. As you watch a Taziya reenactment of the battle, you contemplate to yourself the virtue of righteous resistance. The Imam was truly brave to fight against the tyrant of his time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ashura_2;Death with dignity is better than life with humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ashura_2;Better to live and fight another day, in my opinion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_3;Soon after the events at Karbala, a curious tradition of self-flagellation, or Tatbir, grew among some more zealous Shi'a. A theological debate has broken out before you, as scholars argue whether or not Tatbir is permissible - self-damage is usually considered haram, but some stubbornly adhere to the tradition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ashura_3;I will join the mourners myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ashura_3;Tatbir is a problematic practice, and so I must ban it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_4;On this ninth day, several prominent events occurred - the Tyrant's army besieged the Imam and his companions in Karbala, and preparations for battle were made. Many of the faithful go to Mosques and engage in charity - perhaps you should, as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_ashura_4;I am indisposed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_5;The tenth day of Muharram is here, and commemoration reaches a high point. On this day, the Imam, most of his family, and all of his companions were martyred by the forces of The Tyrant.

EVTOPTA_ashura_5;Every day is Ashura, every land is Karbala.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_6;It has been forty days since the commemoration of Ashura. Traditionally, many would make a pilgrimage to the shrine of the Imam, but as this is unfeasible, many of the devout choose to fast on this day in final commemoration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ashura_6;I will join the fast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ashura_6;I do not think that is necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ashura_6;I cannot fast - I am at war!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
