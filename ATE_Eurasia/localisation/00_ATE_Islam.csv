TXT_ashura_begins;You begin commemmorating Ashura.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_2;The anniversary of the first day of the battle in Karbala has arrived, and with it, mourners in black flock the streets.

EVTOPTB_ashura_4;I am indisposed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_5;The tenth day of Muharram is here, and commemoration reaches a high point.

EVTOPTA_ashura_5;Every day is Ashura, every land is Karbala.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_6;It has been forty days since the commemoration of Ashura. Traditionally, many would make a pilgrimage to the shrine of the Imam, but as this is unfeasible, many of the devout choose to fast on this day in final commemoration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ashura_6;I will join the fast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ashura_6;I do not think that is necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ashura_6;I cannot fast - I am at war!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
