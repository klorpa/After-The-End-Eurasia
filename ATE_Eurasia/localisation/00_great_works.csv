wonder_oxford_library;The Bod Archives;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_oxford_library_desc;Located in the hallowed ruins of a great Manor of Learning, "The Bod Archives" was believed to have been founded by the ancient order of Bodley who gathered all the wordly knowledge in great codices which were once world renowned, now only the few with the eclectic understanding to decipher the worn scribbles are said to fully grasp its hidden truths. "Do fidem me nullum librum vel" continues its haunting melody among the weary locals who cast their eyes upon its warded door.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_neuschwanstein;Palace of the Fairy King;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_neuschwanstein_desc;The ruins of a castle of titanic dimensions can be found here, it's lonely tower stretching its white spire into the sky. The ancient halls have fantastical murals in them and plenty of items said be originating from this place can be found in castles of the nobility of the area. Folk tell the tale that in moon-light nights, the King of Fairies appears in the ruin and makes a voyage over the night sky with his wondrous court. The astonishing travel ends at the shore of Starnberg Lake, where the King proceeds to submerge to court the Queen of Mermaids, travelling back the next night. A small cross marks the spot where the King and his fellowship enter the water.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
