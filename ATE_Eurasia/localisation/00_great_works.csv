wonder_kronborg_castle_desc;This Great Fortress at the narrowest point Øresund, forever immortalized as the Castle "Elsinore", has stood centuries from its legendary builder Erik VII who forged this castle from the sea as a great bulwark against the forces of Europe from the Great North. A symbol of Scandanavia's continued resilience, it has become the jewel of the Northern People of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_oxford_library;The Bod Archives;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_oxford_library_desc;Located in the hallowed ruins of a great Manor of Learning, "The Bod Archives" was believed to have been founded by the ancient order of Bodley who gathered all the wordly knowledge in great codices which were once world renowned, now only the few with the eclectic understanding to decipher the worn scribbles are said to fully grasp its hidden truths. "Do fidem me nullum librum vel" continues its haunting melody among the weary locals who cast their eyes upon its warded door.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

wonder_walhalla_desc;In this Hall above the Danube, the faces and names of many ancient Germans are enshrined here, as well as, noteworthy and pious rulers from after the Event have found their final resting place in these hallowed halls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_orszaghaz;Országház;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_orszaghaz_desc;This magnificient palace, towering nearly a hundred meters above the Danube, was once the place where the Lords and Ladies of Hungary were said to assemble to discuss matters of utmost importance. Built in Gothic Revival style, This building bolsters a symmetrical façade and a huge dome, under which the royal regalia has been preserved for many generations of Hungarians. The Splendors of Old Hungary were said to be so great that many peoples and material went to the heart of Budapest to make this gleaming Palace one of the most iconic buildings of Europe. Made into Ruins and abandoned after the Event, it was through the efforts of the Visegrad Emperors that this ancient palace have risen from the Ashes recapturing its former Splendor and Glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_palatul_parlamentului;Palatul Parlamentului;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_palatul_parlamentului_desc;The Grand and imposing Home to the Old Emperors of Romania dwarfs all of other cities around it. This enormous fortress, said to be built in 13 years by countless laborers, was in its glory days, home to the Pre-Event Romanian Emperors and many of the nobles of the majestic Parliament who stood as council to their liege. But one begins to wonder if any of that was true for it would mean there was maybe tens of thousands of people who occupy its seemingly endless amount of rooms. After the Unification of Romania once more after the Event, the Emperors of Romania and later the Kings of Wallachia have made this great Palace their own. Traveling through its beautiful and haunted halls it is said to be the most impenetrable fortification ever constructed in not only Bucharest but perhaps the entire world?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
