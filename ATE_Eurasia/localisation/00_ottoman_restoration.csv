#Events

EVTNAMEottoman.1;Restoration of Western Sham;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman.1;Long ago the Holy land of Ibrahim and Musa was lost to unruly governors and upstart rulers who wish to divide us. But through our efforts Kudüs i-Serif in the Holy city of Jerusalem is once again under our jurisdiction. Pilgrims of all creeds come flocking back to these holy sites under our most magnanimous gaze. This is yet another step to proclaiming the past glory of [e_ottoman_empire.GetName] restored!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.1;The Foul Snakes of Sykes and Picot are no more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEottoman.2;Restoration of Misr;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman.2;The treasured and ancient land of Yusuf was once the breadbasket of the sublime state, but it was lost to a cunning Pasha who swore off his Muslim brothers and flocked to join the conspirators, whose honey words convinced him to proclaim himself "Sultan". This very act of betrayal tore the passage to the Maghrib away from [e_ottoman_empire.GetName]! With the false rulers defeated and the emulators of Firaun crushed, you can not help but bask in the wisdom from Al-Azhar as you contemplate your next move in furthering the glory of [e_ottoman_empire.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.2;May future Pashas know our might!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEottoman.3;Restoration of Tripolitania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman.3;Tarabulus al-Gharbiyye was the stone in the path of the enemy - with brave Ghazi fighting back against the encroaching Roman state, our ancestors ensured Tripolitania would not be given without a fight. Now, with all of Libya restored under the Sublime state, valiant administrators are observing once more the ports of Benghazi and Tripoli, ensuring that the sacrifices of Umar Mukhtar and other lions are never forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.3;May the enemies collapse in front of the Lions of Allah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEottoman.4;Restoration of Tunisia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman.4;Tunis, long a port of envy among the world, was lost in the chaos of international treachery and the triparitate aggression. Now, in a feat worthy of Kiliç Ali Pasha, the authority of the [e_ottoman_empire.GetName] has been restored among these western provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.4;May the Dey know their sacrifice was not in vain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEottoman.5;Restoration of Al-Jaza'ir;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman.5;These lands are home to the fierce and mighty people of Jaza'ir, and are famed for the twin regents Baba Oruç and Hizir Hayrettin whose great exploits against the twin false crowns are well known stories, even among those from Avrupa. Now that these heroic lands have once again been restored, the restoration of the regency has commenced as many governors once more station the frontiers of the Maghrib protecting the bedrock of the [e_ottoman_empire.GetName]'s presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.5;May these regents be as mighty as the Great Barbarossa!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEottoman.6;The Golden Apple;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman.6;Istanbul, once the gleaming capital of the [e_ottoman_empire.GetName], has once more been reclaimed by those that believe in our cause. Wandering the streets of the ancient city, you are struck by the beauty - Sultanahmet, Suleymaniyye, Ayasofya stand tall, dominating the skies. You look upon the ancient walls, which have withstood the corrosive march of time. You contemplate the many works of Mimar Sinan, upon the University, and upon the buildings which scream history. Most of all, you contemplate the glad tidings of conquest which foretold this treasured city's capture by Fatih Sultan Mehmet, a name the world knows as a legend. As you walk, you hear the Azan from a nearby masjid - you know you have a lot of work ahead of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.6;"What a wonderful leader will he be, and what a wonderful army will that army be!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEottoman.7;Uniting Anadolu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman.7;Anadolu, the home of the Turk, the treasured plains and hills who tell stories of the many Ghazi who rode upon horseback to fight against the forces of Rome, has once more been unified under the banner of the Sublime State.  It was here that Osman Ghazi built his supreme state after a magnificent dream. It was here that Mustafa Kemal Ghazi broke the hands of the triparitate invaders and saved Anadolu for the ummah, and it is here that the [e_ottoman_empire.GetName] will restore that magnificent dream. Now that Anadolu is once more united, can it be that you may have that same thunderous spirit? Only God knows best. As the last Beys swear fealty to you, you raise your hands to heaven for answers for the task ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.7;We have been here for a thousand years, we shall be here for a thousand years!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEottoman.8;Restoration of Hijaz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman.8;The Holy Cities of Medine and Mekke are where the blessed Messenger of God, Muhammad Mustafa, peace and blessings upon him, his family, and his companions, revealed the final teachings of God almighty. The Heart of the Ummah was once part of the [e_ottoman_empire.GetName]. With the betrayal of the false Custodians and the trickery of the foreign invaders Sykes and Picot, these lands fell from grace, and the dark clouds of factionalism descended upon them, leading to the long divide and the misrule of the Wahabbi fitna. Now that jurisdiction of the blessed cities is once more part of the empire, we can serve the pilgrims and the Haramayn as its proper custodians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.8;May we honor these blessed lands and serve Allah faithfully!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEottoman.9;Restoration of Yemen Eyalet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman.9;The Southern Province of Yemen, led by its ruler [k_yemen.Holder.GetFullName], have submitted to the [e_ottoman_empire.GetName] in recognition of our Islamic brotherhood. These mighty warriors, who, through the fierceness of their terrain have cultivated an unconquerable spirit, have joined us in exchange for autonomy. Once more the Crescent flag flies over Sana'a, its Pasha ready to defend these ancient lands at all costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.9;May it be prosperous, inshallah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEottoman.10;Restoration of Bahrayn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman.10;The Eastern Province of Lahsa formed the bulwark of the Sublime State in the Gulf. Ever fickle, its leaders often never fully appreciated the splendors of [e_ottoman_empire.GetName]. Regardless, these lands, once conquered by Kanuni Sultan Suleiman himself, are now once more under the Sublime State. Now that we have ended the divisions in these areas and have restored order, may the people know the full glory of the Empire's fruits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.10;Ameen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEottoman.11;Restoration of Iraq;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman.11;;The Eyalets of Iraq were the victims of the attack by the triparitate's aggression. Fierce swords clashing on the soils of Basra leading to the pyrrhic defense of Kut, only to be swept away by the armies of Sykes and Picot. Now that these provinces are once more part of the Empire, the last vestiges of the anarchy have been crushed, and the invaders' dreams cast back to whence they came. [e_ottoman_empire.GetName] has become the undisputed master of the two rivers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.11;Alhamdulillah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEottoman.12;Restoration of Rumelia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman.12;The Land of the Romans was once the crownlands of the Sublime state, providing many of the brave and valiant statesmen who guided our nation. Now, once more does the Crescent flag fly over these lands, the lands from which arose Muhtesem Iskander, Kosem Sultan, and many other famed figures throughout history. With these green lands restored, perhaps this will be the starting point into greater Avrupa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.12;May we march ever northwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEottoman.13;Restoration of the Balkans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman.13;The Land of the Southern Slavs, a people of ferocious fighting spirit, has once more been restored by the forces of the [e_ottoman_empire.GetName]. These people were said to have joined crucial battles in the name of the Sublime State and contributed many famed Vezir's and statesmen. With these lands once more under our sway, further conquest north can be realized - perhaps the Golden Apple has landed in Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.13;Breakfast in Budapest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEottoman.14;Rememberance of Mohac;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman.14;In a battle that echoes through history, Kanuni Sultan Suleiman crushed the disbelievers on the plains of Mohac. Once more, these lands are under our sway, as the Crescent banner flows over the gates of Budapest. With this Sanjak restored, and our authority in Avrupa the strongest it has been in centuries, the Golden Apple has now grown in the city of the German emperors - Vienna stands in our path to glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.14;Juma'ah in Vienna, inshallah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEottoman.15;The Restoration of the Qirim;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman.15;Once the home to the mighty Qirim tatar, who rode alongside our armies to fight against the Rus, Qirim was lost in the treachery of the false Kaysar, and our Muslim brethren were subject to horrific abuse. Taking over the port of Aqyar, we have firmly placed ourselves in the vicinity to watch the so-called "Third Rome" from across the strait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.15;The false Kaysar shall quiver before our might!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEottoman.16;The Capture of Vienna;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman.16;You have done it... you have fulfilled the dream of Kununi Sultan Suleiman. Looking at the gates of Vienna, the crescent flag waving on the walls solemnly. You behold in your hand an apple, glistening like the sun, a radiant gold. You look upon the feast of many centuries in the making and throw it in the air, allowing it to land in the middle of the map of Avrupa. You awaken an invigorated man, as Avrupa lays before you as open lands for your great armies, for the great gateway to further conquest has been opened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.16;Tekbir!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEottoman.20;A Dream Most Magnificent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman.20;The [e_ottoman_empire.GetName], the Sublime State, was an empire that stretched for centuries upon the backs of noble and wise rulers who meticulously cultivated its grandeur among the people who resided in its borders and well beyond. Its history alone - from a principality to one that dominated three continents, produced many legendary figures of which many other states have since tried to emulate with varying levels of success. But not you. You have done what none other has done before and reforged this ancient empire from a most magnificent dream, your acclaim matching those legendarily recorded by its greatest rulers, as Osman's dream finds itself realized once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.20;May our justice sway across the lands again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEottoman.21;The Renewed Sublime State;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman.21;[e_ottoman_empire.GetName], previously referred to as "Turkey" by many in Europe, has somehow managed to reclaim enough lost territory to declare themselves the Ottoman Empire restored! It can no longer be denied that they are the true successors of the Sultans of Old and their glorious legacy. They claim a new era is upon us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.21;Can it be true?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBottoman.21;But... was I not the most enlightened?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCottoman.30;In honor of the Empire's recent victory, it would be appropriate to hold a celebration in the capital for the heroic ghazi who fought in the campaign. Such an arrangement will be expensive, but the people expect nothing less.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.30;Yes, a glorious celebration will be held.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBottoman.30;A brief speech before prayer should be enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCottoman.30;No, we have no time for such nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIPottoman.31;A celebration is held in Istanbul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman.31;A grand celebration is held in the City of Wonder to celebrate the brave soldiers who brought glory upon the World's State. The people cheer as gold is thrown from long carriages; the procession being led by Mehter proudly playing glorious tunes of conquest and victory. This celebration will be spoken of for many decades; already many consider it equal to the festivities held for Hurrem Sultan's wedding to our ancestor, Kanuni Sultan Suleiman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.31;The Sublime state marches onwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCottoman.32;The [Root.Liege.GetTitle] has commanded that a celebration be held in the capital to celebrate the brave soldiers responsible for the Empire's recent victories. The people cheer as alms are distributed and drummers lead a long procession that includes parading soldiers and performers from around the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.32;An impressive display.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEottoman.40;The Old Borders Are Restored;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman40_MUSLIM;The story of the [e_ottoman_empire.GetName]'s glorious recovery will be told throughout the ages. Those unfortunate is enough to have lived through the black days when the tripartite invaders and the traitors of the Islamic world plotted together to lay low the empire and sow chaos and disorder among the world, those who fed upon the corpse of the empire would not have dared dream of this day. All of the old provinces have been reclaimed and the Empire now stretches farther than it has in nearly a thousand years.\nThe azan sounds across the Empire and the wider Islamic world as prayers are being made to celebrate this momentous occasion and men and women from Al-Jaza'ir to Bagdat are weeping tears of joy. It will be a challenge to keep an empire of this scale together, but for the sake of all humanity you must succeed, lest the world plunge into yet another dark age of ignorance and barbarity without the steady hand of governance of the Sublime State.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEottoman.45;Succession of the Sultan Khan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman.45;You, the sultan of sultans, the sovereign of sovereigns, the dispenser of crowns to the monarchs on the face of the earth, shadow of God on earth, the sultan and sovereign lord of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, of Rumelia and Anatolia, of Karaman and the land of Rum, of Dulkadir, Diyarbakir, of Kurdistan, of Azerbaijan, Damascus, Cairo, Aleppo, of the Mecca and Medina, of Jerusalem, of all Arabia, of the Yemen and many other lands, which your noble forefathers and your glorious ancestors - may God light up their tombs - conquered by the force of their arms and which you now, with the grace of God, rule over. You stand as the new Sultan of the [e_ottoman_empire.GetName]. May your reign be a prosperous one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.45;Ameen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCottoman.46;You are no longer the ruler of the [e_ottoman_empire.GetName]. It will surely crumble without your guiding hand to lead it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAottoman.46;What a loss for the Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
