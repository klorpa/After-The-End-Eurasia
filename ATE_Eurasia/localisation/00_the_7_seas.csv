hunt_for_whale_desc;Hunting the great beasts of the sea is something of a rite of passage for many Pelagic men and women, you should consider embarking on a hunt yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

recent_whaling;Recent whaling;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_pelagic1;At dawn you make your way to the docks and speak with the captains of two ships willing to take you with them on a Whale hunt. The first is a large and impressive ship whose captain demands a high price but assures you that it is quite worth it. The second ship is smaller and looks like it has seen better days, but its captain only asks for a quarter of the price...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_pelagic1;Money is no object, I must take the best ship possible!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_pelagic1;The second ship seems fine, and it's cost is reasonable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_pelagic2;Dark clouds have been sighted on the horizon and the sea is turbulent. The crew mutters nervously and prepare for rough sailing while others clutch their bone charms and make offerings to the sea. Perhaps you should join one of these groups.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_pelagic2;This is no time for rituals, we must prepare for a storm!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_pelagic2;Sedna is angered, she must be appeased!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_pelagic3;The crew has been acting suspiciously since leaving port, muttering amongst themselves and quieting when you or the Captain draw near. Your suspicions are confirmed when several armed men corner you in your cabin. They have risen in mutiny!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_pelagic3;These brigands must be stopped! To Arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_pelagic3;"Wait! Do not attack, I can pay you!";;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_pelagic4;The hunt is over, the crew were kind enough to take you back home but you unmistakably have failed your quest to hunt a great whale. Now you will have to deal with the consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_pelagic4;I return empty-handed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_pelagic5;After weeks at sea a whale has been sighted! The crew are in good cheer, the trials of the voyage forgotten in the excitement of having prey in sight. An old and scarred sailor gives a toothless grin, leans over to you, and says "Now comes the hard part, good hunting!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_pelagic5;Full speed ahead! The Whale awaits!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_pelagic5;We must approach cautiously.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_pelagic6;The Whale has been slain! You were given the honor of harpooning it while the crew took care of the rest. A cask of foul-smelling drink has been opened and many in the crew are celebrating the successful hunt, though you notice a handful making offerings to the sea in thanks for the bounty it has given you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_pelagic6;"You there! Pour me some of whatever that is!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_pelagic6;Celebration can come later, respect must be paid.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_pelagic7;The Whale has escaped, perhaps your pursuit was not aggressive enough, or this particular beast was craftier than most. Regardless, you have still not succeeded in catching a Whale.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_pelagic7;This is but a setback. We must continue!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_pelagic7;I have grown tired of this hunt, perhaps we should return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_pelagic8;You have returned home victorious. While the crew of the ship takes their share of the whale, you must decide what to do with what you have taken.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_pelagic8;I must visit a scrimshander and have something carved from these bones.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_pelagic8;I will take my share to the market and sell it;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_pelagic9;The Scrimshander, a wiry old man with strange markings on his hands, carefully appraises the bone you brought him. "Aye, I reckon I could make something out of this. A charm perhaps? To ward off storms and foul tidings. Or maybe a knife or even some sort of pendant. It is your choice.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_pelagic9;A bone charm you say?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_pelagic9;The knife sounds good;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_pelagic9;I'll take the pendant;;;;;;;;;;;;x
