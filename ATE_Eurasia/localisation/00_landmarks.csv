landmark_heidelberg_belt;§YHeidelberg Belt§!\nStretching from the top of the Heiligenberg Mountain down to the Old Bridge crossing the Neckar river up to the high peaks of Mount Königstuhl, this line or fortifications is unique in its defensive capabilities and cultural value. Here the Neckar leaves the Odenwald mountains and flows into the Rhine valley, the Castle Belt protecting the access upriver to the swabian heartlands. A number of monasteries stand atop the Heiligenberg mountain and its slopes, their bells joining the tune of their sisters hanging in the towers of the pre-event churches in the town of Heidelberg itself. Stretching the river is the Old Bridge, a safe river crossing bringing a lot of trade with it, protected by bulwarks and towers. If needed, the defenders can lay a chain over the river, blocking it from all traffic. Overlooking the town and its shrunken university is the castle itself, a bulwark partially consisting out of the walls of a pre-event predecessor. With another castle with a high tower on Mount Königstuhl itself keeping watch over the greater area, this line of fortifications is a unique combination of military might, trade, culture and wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_capbreton_gouf;§YCapbreton Gouf§!\nWhile most of the knowledge acquired around this mysterious undersea canyon has long been lost since the Event, the Gouf still attracts the curiosity of many, from fishermen trying to catch red mullets or scorpion fishes to brave wave riders defying the colossal rollers crashing onto the yellow sand beaches. However, mysteries do not come without rumors : the Gouf is seen by some as the home of legendary sea creatures devastating the few boats braving the Atlantic during storms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_pech_de_bugarach;§YPech de Bugarach§!\nSummit of the Corbières mountain chain, Bugarach is known in the region for its colossal elevation and the pagans that settled ontop of the peak just after the Event, claiming to be the disciples of a certain Cosmic Christ, before eventually vanishing without a trace. The place is still appreciated by the local nobility, whose most adventurous members like to climb the mountain while trying to escape the dusk and an almost certain death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_legoland;§YLeg Godt Castle§!\nLocated on the fields of Billund, Leg Godt Castle and the surrounding "Old City" of Billund, has been recounted to be home to a carpenter magician turned baron of Billund. The Baron Ole Kirk was said to have fashioned colorful bricks of such stunning quality that his craft was known the world over. His creation lovingly called by the locals its short-name "Lego", has survived the centuries of wear from the Event. The magnificent well-preserved colored bricks which once formed impenetrable walls still stand solemnly as small bands of locals recount the many stories and adventures of its illustrious baron for he had played his cards well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_la_bonne_mere;§YLa Bonne Mère§!\nDominating the shipyard of Marseille, La Bonne Mère is now far from his legendary aspect: it is said that a massive gold statue representing Mary and her child protected the sailors leaving the shipyard. The alleged site held by the cathedral is still a place of worship, and the Bonne Mère plays a major role in provencal Catholic folklore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_cap_de_creus;§YCap de Creus§!\nWhile the local catalunyan sailors fear more the Cap de Creus than they admire its beauty, the latter is rather undeniable: the lunar landscapes the Cap de Creus offers are well-known accross Catalunya and widely appreciated for the long hikes it can offer. But beware of the winds that crash against the cape...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_keukenhof;§YThe Garden of Europe§!\nAround Sinterklaas, hundreds of thousands of flowers are planted in Keukenhof by specifically appointed gardeners in presence of the Patricians of Holland. A few months later, what were simple bulbs turn into beautiful orchid and tulips, resulting in a rather colourful garden in the spring. It is said that the tradition goes back to many years before the Event, and seems to still be appreciated by Europa's nobles, who often frequent the garden from the wet sundays of early spring to the long warm days of summer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_grand_place;§YGrand Place§!\nIn the epicenter of Brussels, the small and sinuous streets lead to the commercial and symbolical center of the city : Grand Place, or Grote Markt. When the foreign nobles aren't parading around the Place, it is the rich merchants selling precious goods from all around Eurasia or the poets trying to catch the bypassers' attention with their latest sonnets to the glory to Saint Kierkegaard who are animating the Place. The Markt is an important place in the Empire, and probably has been way before the latter's existence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_drachenfeld;§YDrachenfeld§!\nOn the heights of Bonn lies a mysterious and odd castle. Indeed, the so-called Drachenburg and its surrounding domain contrasts with the other surrounding castles: it seems that Drachenfeld  simply comes from another world. The pointy towers and the excentric architecture is said to be the work of a so-called Von Sarter, whose greediness and wealth acquired in working with Hansa patricians helped him build the Drachenburg and the amusing legends that its apparition resulted in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_ruhrpott_hills;§YRuhrpott Hills§!\nWandering around the paths of the Ruhr valley, one will often notice unusually high grass hills among a scenery that doesn't offer much heights otherwise. These hills are said to have been part of a mysterious underground society that carved the earth from the inside and wished for societal change. Unfortunately, the few tries to uncover the hills' secret were unsuccessful, and the hills are nothing more than a pleasant sight to the locals' eyes now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_gravensteen;§YGravensteen§!\nThe center of Gent, Gravensteen is a mighty and heavily defended castle that has known its disturbances both before and after the Event. However, it seems that the castle's memory has kept being strong over the times among the local nobility and clergy, as it seems that Gravensteen is now still a standing Castle. The evergoing conflicts in Europa is said to have played in the decision too,and it seems to have bore its fruits : Gravensteen still holds its reputation among Belgian rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_kellerwald;§YKellerwald§!\nFor the average human being, Kellerwald will look like a typical regular forest with some enjoyable sceneries. However, some locals claim the forest is one of the oldest in the Empire, and that it still holds many mysteries : one could be confronted to rather unusual visions if they adventure themselves deep in the forest...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_altona_cemetery;§YAltona Cemetery§!\nThis Sephardic cemetery has been an important place for the said community, which still uses the cemetery and the surrounding neighbourhood as a centerpoint for most of their activities : on Yom Kippour, the celebrations are massive and attract jewish people from all of Northern Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_bryggen;§YBryggen§!\nLying on the extremity of a system of fjords facing the Northern Atlantic, the town of Bergen is an important commercial chokepoint for Norway, and has been for quite a while. Indeed, the portuary neighbourhood of Bryggen is under control of the Hanseatic League, who benefit from and control most of the trade. However Bryggen is not only an important trading post : its small, intricate and colourful wooden houses are worth a walk through the neighbourhood during the fresh summer evenings the winds bring to the Norse coast every year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_notre_dame_des_landes;§YLa Grée et ses environs§!\nSouth of Notre-Dame des Landes' castle, following the road to Nantes, one might notice, among the fields, marshes and forests, a certain number of wooden cabins and huts of all different sizes and structures, centered around a farm, a place known as "La Grée". Each one of those  holds a specific, sometimes enigmatic name, only known by those living in the surrounding area : "Phare-Ouest", "Bison Futé", "Les 100 Noms", "Kazh Koat", "Le Gourbi"... Locals claim people have been installed there for a long time, refusing to be governed by anyone but themselves and sharing everything they produce. The local nobles seem to have simply abandoned trying to force their feudalization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_uppsala_cathedral;§YUppsala Domkyrka§!\nThe Grand Cathedral of Uppsala, the beating heart of the Luthern World and especially among the people of Scandanavia. It's imposing spires being a beacon of Christendom in the Great North of Europe. Swedish kings since Gustav Vasa have interned and made heirlooms of their great faith within these halls. The Thornan chiming above, a small curious stone remains prominent in the candlelight. A pronouncement of true devotion: "Not I, but God in me.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_skanelinjen;§YSkånelinjen§!\n"The Scanian Line" is a series of pre-event concrete hills on the flat, smooth sands of the Scanian beaches. Legends proclaim that a great steward of ancient Sweden, Per Albin, built these great mounds to ward off a continental invasion of a people now long gone. While some of these fortifications have been dug up, slender looters worming through the tiny openings facing the sea, or tearing the rusty, thick steel doors off of their hinges, nothing has been found. Although some less superstitious folks use the excavated concrete rooms as dirt cellars, the Folketro peasants of the region believe that the spirits of the Scanian soils still inhabit these hills, dutifully watching the coast for European invaders. Or worse yet; the return of the Danes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_gamla_stan_stockholm;§YGamla Stan§!\nThe Old Town of Stockholm is an ancient island littered with churches and palaces between narrow, winding streets, which weathered the storm of the event to defend the people of Stockholm from the darkest days, and quickly retook its place as the center of the traditional capital of Sweden. The churches of Saint Nicolai and Riddarholmskyrkan tower over the busy streets, and Tyska Kyrkan once again holds its services in German; catering to Neuhumanist and other continental traders such as the Hanseatic League. The Royal Palace, home of Swedish kings throughout the ages, stands on the waterfront, the equally venerable old senate of the realm looming adjacent, on the smaller Helgeandsholmen. Laying squarely in the center of old Stockholm, the island controls access to the Mälaren river system, and thus all of Svealand, the heartland of the ancient kingdom..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_falun_mines;§YFalun Mines§!\nThe Great Copper mines of Falun are world renown for its rich deposits of Copper which was said to have supplied nearly two-thirds of all the Copper in Europe at its peak.

Nowadays the mountains silcene is only interrupted by the prayers, hymnes and talks of the pilgrims and visitors.
