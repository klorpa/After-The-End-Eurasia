landmark_heidelberg_belt;§YHeidelberg Belt§!\nStretching from the top of the Heiligenberg Mountain down to the Old Bridge crossing the Neckar river up to the high peaks of Mount Königstuhl, this line or fortifications is unique in its defensive capabilities and cultural value. Here the Neckar leaves the Odenwald mountains and flows into the Rhine valley, the Castle Belt protecting the access upriver to the swabian heartlands. A number of monasteries stand atop the Heiligenberg mountain and its slopes, their bells joining the tune of their sisters hanging in the towers of the pre-event churches in the town of Heidelberg itself. Stretching the river is the Old Bridge, a safe river crossing bringing a lot of trade with it, protected by bulwarks and towers. If needed, the defenders can lay a chain over the river, blocking it from all traffic. Overlooking the town and its shrunken university is the castle itself, a bulwark partially consisting out of the walls of a pre-event predecessor. With another castle with a high tower on Mount Königstuhl itself keeping watch over the greater area, this line of fortifications is a unique combination of military might, trade, culture and wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
