EVTDESCvalinorist.141;Pregnancy hasn't benn entirely easy, but still the thought of the life growing inside fills you with maternal emotion. In this contemplation your mind turns to Vana Ever-young, whose domain is beauty and youth. Long has it been the tradition of the Faithful to beseech her for the blessing of their children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvalinorist.141;Much power there is in her grace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCvalinorist.142;In the garden nearby stands a small shrine to Vana: an arrangement of blossoms and sweet smelling plants. Valinorists find little use for single structures in the worship of the All-Father and reverence of the Powers. There, amongst the flowers and living things rooted loosely in the foundations of Arda, you kneel. Words of parentage and love flow from you, and you ask Vana to guide you in your bearing of the child, and to lead them to health and joy beneath the eyes of the One. It is the Theme of the Children to beget life anew as they did. When you are done you rise from your stance amongst the brilliant colored flowers, refreshed and glad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
