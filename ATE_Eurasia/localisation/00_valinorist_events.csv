EVTDESCvalinorist.141;Pregnancy hasn't been entirely easy, but still the thought of the life growing inside fills you with maternal emotion. In this contemplation your mind turns to Vana Ever-young, whose domain is beauty and youth. Long has it been the tradition of the Faithful to beseech her for the blessing of their children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvalinorist.141;Much power there is in her grace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBvalinorist.141;My child needs no aid but my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist.142;In the garden nearby stands a small shrine to Vana: an arrangement of blossoms and sweet smelling plants. Valinorists find little use for single structures in the worship of the All-Father and reverence of the Powers. There, amongst the flowers and living things rooted loosely in the foundations of Arda, you kneel. Words of parentage and love flow from you, and you ask Vana to guide you in your bearing of the child, and to lead them to health and joy beneath the eyes of the One. It is the Theme of the Children to beget life anew as they did. When you are done you rise from your stance amongst the brilliant colored flowers, refreshed and glad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvalinorist.142;May the hale of the Ever-young be with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
valinor_vana_preg;Vana's Guidance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist.143;One day, you become separated from the other children while playing near the shore. Briefly alone, you scramble along the surf, and turn out to the sea. In the moment you look, all of Arda seems to hold its breath, plunging day and night beneath the face of the water. Waves rise and crash, sea-green waters turning to foam and returning back to their state, taking and beaching upon the sand. In the salt-scented air are heard the whisper-words of far away, drifting on tides that languor on to distant lands. They beckon you to voyage after, chasing lock step beneath Tilion of the Moon, riding forever through Ulmo's hall. You see yourself in the ship-brimmed ports, alone in secret routes, swimming besides mysteries of the deep. \n \n In time the flustered courtiers drag you away, admonishing you for becoming separated. Their warnings are meaningless. You know now that you will long ever after for the sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvalinorist.143;My heart shall rest on these sands forevermore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

####Valinorist Gift of Men/Suicide Breathing Thonk Events#####
valinorist_fea_study.1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.1;In your search to understand the Gift of Men, you have many discussions with your court wizard. Over time, the aprehension you feel towards the Gift begins to fade away. The role it fills is slowly revealed to you: a path to further growth, a severance from endless sorrows within the confines of Arda.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvalinorist_fea.1;Truly the Allfather is wise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.1A;In your search to understand the Gift of Men, you have many discussions with your court wizard. "The Gift is often hard to understand, my lord" [Root.job_spiritual.GetBestName] says one night. "Its view is tainted by the lies of Morgoth. By the Enemy's work, we fear that is an end to all things good and worthy.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBvalinorist_fea.1;Is it not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.1B;"An end it is, but not the end to all things - beyond the house of death is the Outer Sea, whose waves carry us all to unknown shores. It is only fear holds us to Arda past our time, till even life is only a pain we no longer wish to endure: we grow old, trapped in ever increasing pain, sure that somehow to continue in it will lessen the agony. Morgoth's lie tells us to keep steadfast, rejecting the will of Eru Illuvitar in reverence of our own selves.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvalinorist_fea.101;I must trust in The Allfather's wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.2;The Eldar, Illuvitar's Firstborn, have come to your mind often in the last few months. None there are left, but for those who linger as wraiths and houseless spirits, fire invisible to mortal sight. As you research their fate, you realize it is a different existence than that of Men, but not always better, for each was made for a grander design. In time, you find yourself seeing Death as a natural part of your body and soul, an intrinsic part of your humanity. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvalinorist_fea.2;We shall know each other fully, come Arda Unmarred.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.2A;The Eldar, Illuvitar's Firstborn, have come to your mind often in the last few months. None there are left, but for those who linger as wraiths and houseless spirits, fire invisible to mortal sight. You ask your wizard of them and the Gift when you have the chance. "[Root.job_spiritual.GetBestName], there were others with another gift, once. Why does their's seem so much greater than ours?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBvalinorist_fea.2;Why do we bear this Gift?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.2B;"My liege, this is a question many have asked. Wrongly they think of the Eldars' doom to be a higher blessing than what they recieved - but this is untrue. To live bound to Arda is a pain all its own just as wearying as the grave-griefs of men. The Firstborn cannot escape this world, and must live with the fullness of their woes. Their sorrows mount up ever higher, a trap from which they find no release. But for the bliss of Aman, they would remain in the taint of Morgoth's Ring for all time. Our Gift frees us of this fate.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvalinorist_fea.201;This doom is strange to mortal ears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.3;Frequent study has filled your dream with many visages of late. Alluring shapes of untouched cold, shadowy mirages perched with iron bands, and shrunken, dishevelled frames of pity become familiar in your sleeping thoughts. There remains the allure of stretching one's days, twisting them to escape the grave-bed as these did - but your increasing knowledge reveals it for the perversion it is. They merely increased their time by mingling it with death, and lived with malice and pain. Soon the dreams fade, and you become more ready to find joy in what time you have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvalinorist_fea.3;Would life really be worth living without an end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.3A;Frequent study has filled your dream with many visages of late. Alluring shapes of untouched cold, shadowy mirages perched with iron bands, and shrunken, dishevelled frames of pity become familiar in your sleeping thoughts. One night you awake in a cold sweat, and head down to see your court Wiseman. \n \n "I have been haunted by sinister ideals, [Root.job_spiritual.GetBestName]. Angmar, Ar-Pharzon, barrows and deep-dwelled homes of unkept oaths - they dominate my hours. Tell me, was there no further life in what they experienced? Though lessened, were they not still amongst mortal Arda?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBvalinorist_fea.3;Have spirits such as this bested the Gift?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.3B;Though tired, the wizard is understanding of your fright. "No, [ROOT.GetTitle], not in the sense you understand. Though we see many records of personages across great spans of age, it is as one who has one foot out the door into the next world. Their's were spans wracked with fear and regret, and still moving as surely to the Halls of Mandos as any other, if only slower by mortal eyes. No years of life did they truly add, only mingling them to another material, as one tries to increase the supply of gold by mixing it with copper. Hroa faded, degraded, and fea was left a prisoner in an ever decaying house, just as afraid of what lay beyond in freedom as it was dissatisfied with its present bondage.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvalinorist_fea.301;A thin, shadowy life hardly worth living.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.4;Discussion of the Gift with [Root.job_spiritual.GetBestName] has turned to the relation of the spirit to that of the body. You learn about the nature of two, and how for Men thaey are as partners. The Gift of Death sunders them for a time, but not forever. Away from the confines of Arda, the soul increses, and shall return to a body also increased. There they will be joiined again, perfected and free from the influence of the Enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvalinorist_fea.4;So it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.4A;Discussion of the Gift with [Root.job_spiritual.GetBestName] has turned to the relation of the spirit to that of the body. You have considered as to how they can truly be bonded if so much time and destiny sunders them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBvalinorist_fea.4;Why do we dwell in Arda at all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.4B;[Root.job_spiritual.GetBestName] is long in thought before answering. "Body and spirit are disjointed indeed, my lord. But do not be mistaken, for this divsion is not one of design but malice. For the Secondborn are not as one in two parts, but two brought together in one. Hroa and Fea are meant to be united in joy, fastened with both the experiences of Arda and the Music beyond the Outer Sea. Our Gift allowed us this duality. Yet no longer do these partners sing in perfect sound. The Black Foe introduced discord early on in the Years of the Sun, and so disharmony has entered our union. Understand that this is against the Design of the One, a marring of the Enemy. Yet, there is a Hope still, revealed to Men by our own Gift: that by Theme our spirits may increase, and someday we shall return at the Remaking of the World, and then rejoin our bodies in Arda Unmarred.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvalinorist_fea.401;The Music has depth even beyond our hearing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.5;One day you close another tome of debate on the nature of the Gift, and realize that you have not felt the grasp of fear in a long time. You cannot say when it was, but the shadow that settles over so many of your kin has lifted. The understanding of your presence in this world and beyond has at last embraced you, and truth of Eru's Gift works in your heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvalinorist_fea.5;I hear Illuvitar's theme in beauty, now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.6;Now that you have understood better the nature of the Gift of Men, it is time to discover the ways in which one may come to welcome it in the hroa. [Root.job_spiritual.GetBestName] abides with you in the still wilds, explaining the history of Departing. After the silmarillion was rediscovered, the Faithful sought to accept the Gift of Men, but could not do so peacefully. In their turmoil, Manwe sent revelation to the holiest of a way in which the airs may be withdrawn from the body. By specific breathing and focus, those who still love the light of Valinor can release their soul and accept the Gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvalinorist_fea.6;Better to go willingly, than dragged weak and broken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.6A;Now that you have understood better the nature of the Gift of Men, it is time to discover the ways in which one may come to welcome it in the hroa. [Root.job_spiritual.GetBestName] abides with you in the still wilds, explaining the history of Departing. The Faithfull discovered a means by which the soul could be released from the body without bloodshed, a way of breathing whose knowledge was sent by Manwe, Lord of the Air.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBvalinorist_fea.6;Tell me of Acceptance, [Root.job_spiritual.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.6B;"In the early days of the Second Age, the Edain grew righteous and strong. They went willingly to Mandos when their time came, not clinging in desparation to Arda, stricken with age and violence. But in envy of the Firstborn they lessened, and this joy was forgotten for many ages. Soon after the end of the Sixth Age, when the Quenta at last passed out of darkness and ruin, many misunderstood the Gift. By the ancient deceptions of Melkor, they slew themselves, and their light shining from the Secret Fire grew dim in the weaves of Vaire before appointed time. Even when the Istari put this to an end, many were distraught and wearied with their inability to judge the time of their death. It was after much time of reflection and prayer that they heard the Valar speak to them. The Lords of the West delivered understanding of a new way in which to set forth to Mandos, and voyage beyond the Outer Sea.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvalinorist_fea.601;And from there, not even Varda who set the stars may know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.7;At last you begin to learn the actual method of Accpeting the Gift of Men. The one who welcomes death must see Hroa and Fea, Body and Soul, as they were purely designed in the Music of the Ainur. Only when they are sure that this is an act of peace and not cowardice can they go on. Now, by sheer will and focus they must breathe lesser and lesser, struggling against the lies that Morgoth spread even into their very flesh soul regarding Death. But there, at last, the victor may release themselves and journey to the Halls of Mandos. \n \n With this study at last complete, you believe you can now Accept the Gift of Men when you are ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvalinorist_fea.7;A way then, straight and shipless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.7A;After some time, you ask [Root.job_spiritual.GetBestName] for more information on the Undertaking of Acceptance. \n \n "I will speak to you of the ways of Willing Accepetance. It requires one to surrender to the Powers and the One, and to create in lesser fashion a memory of Hroa and Fea as they were sung in the Music of the Ainur before the Throne of Illuvitar. It is a new breathing - a bridge between realms - for when the last breath in Arda is taken, the next shall be in Valinor, at the Sands of Eternity.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBvalinorist_fea.7;A way then, straight and shipless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.7B;"Now, as Blessed Men, we must avoid allowing this act to overcome our appointment to life. There have been many who try to undertake it in order to escape grief and fear, not in true fulfillment of Eru's plan. When properly done, the mind passes through limits of hroa twice. First to overcome the Enemy's shadow, and second to ensure that it is with pure desire that we undertake this deed, understanding that the Gift is an departure from Arda, not ourselves. Remember with sure heart that without body our spirits shall be magnified in both good and evil." \n \n With this study at last complete, you believe you can now Accept the Gift of Men when you are ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvalinorist_fea.701;Bravery is in it, not cowardice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.8;After long years upon Arda, you have elected now to go gladly to the Halls of Mandos. Many of your loved ones are with you as you do this, and they weep unevil tears in the thought of your journey. Your paraphenilia and pomp are laid at your side - sceptre and shield, sword and spear adorn you. You begin to breathe slowly as the Wiseman reads from the Silmarillion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvalinorist_fea.8;May sorrow and wisdom enrich them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.9;"There was Eru, who in Arda is called Illuvitar...." \n \n Soon the voice grows distant as your chest gains time between each rise and fall. What begins as calming, soon grasps you as fear. The ideas of the beyond and a final end fill you, begging you to stay for a minute longer. A day. A year. A century - but far away, you hear the voices from Eldamar singing. The Shadow passes, the Ring of Morgoth breaking in the Flame Imperishable and a music rising from afar. \n \n "-save only Beren, Son of Barahir, whose hand had touched a Silmaril...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvalinorist_fea.9;"...beyond the confines of the world...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.10;You breathe slowly and thinly in the last. As the dim light fades, you could swear you see a distant white shore, a great hall of many souls, and afar a broad sea beyond the curtain of the fading world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvalinorist_fea.10;I go now into the West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCvalinorist_fea.11;Without a capable court wiseman to guide you, your study of the Gift of Men has ground to a halt. If you wish to proceed in this venture you will need to appoint someone to guide you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvalinorist_fea.11;Even the very wise cannot see all ends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
