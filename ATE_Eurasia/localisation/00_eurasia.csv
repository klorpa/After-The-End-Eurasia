high_thelema_DESC;Thelema is a British mystic religion/"spiritual philosophy" developed by Aleister Crowley, based on the law: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." It is a polytheistic religion that draws its pantheon of gods from the religious beliefs of Ancient Egypt. However, their highest deity is someone - or something - known only as "The Queen".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

low_thelema_DESC;Thelema is a British mystic religion/"spiritual philosophy" developed by Aleister Crowley, based on the law: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." It is a polytheistic religion that draws its pantheon of gods from the religious beliefs of Ancient Egypt. Derided as "Low Thelema" by members of the Thelema orthodoxy, Low Thelemites claim they follow the original Thelema and that the High Thelemite orthodoxy has turned away from the law of Light, Liberty, and Love in favor of Anglican tyranny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

high_church_DESC;Anglicanism describes itself as being a "via media", or middle way, between Protestantism and the Catholic Church. Following the Event, the highest authority in Anglicanism is the Archbishop of Canterbury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
high_church_FEATURES;ßY*ß! A sufficiently powerful Anglican leader can vassalize the Archbishop of Canterbury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

free_church_DESC;The Free Churches (Or Nonconformists) are derived from British protestant groups that rejected the authority of the Anglican church after the event. While descended from diverse groups which banded together to survive the post-cataclysm world, the Free Churches share a common belief in the rejection of religious hierarchy, in religious freedom and some degree of pacifism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

insular_DESC;The catholic church in Britain and Ireland has since the event drifted from central authority in Rome. As such authority is now invested in the individual archbishops and each diosceses has its own local customs and even saints without a centralised authority to maintain theological unity. In the realm of Ireland, the Treatise on the Rights of the Church and Clergy passed by King Cormac Lí and the Dáil Éireann made the church in Ireland in particular more attached to the nation than to the pope in Rome, leading to some calling it the ‘Celtic church’ owing to influences from the pre-event ‘Ancient British Church’ and the legend of Saint Paul in Britain, lending catholicism in this area a more nationalistic and romanticist outlook than its mainland cousins.

pelagic_DESC;Worshiped by those who draw on the natural gifts of the sea, the pelagic faith worships the three faces of the sea.  Stone is relatively benevolent, associated with life, healing, and home; Storm is furious, associated with blood, vengence, and storms, and Salt is enigmatic, associated with secrets, travelling, and farewells. In particular, Pelagics regard whales as the most powerful of all seaborne beings, capable of both giving and taking life at a moment's notice. Pelagics have a variety of rituals and superstitutions they follow in hopes that it will grant them the threes favour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

jewish_DESC;Judaism is one of the oldest religions on the planet, and it survived the Event like it did so many other catastrophes. Although Orthodox Judaism's practices have changed relatively little over the last few centuries, the Jews of post-Event Eurasia now face discrimination and persecution on a scale unheard of since before the event. Most Jews in Eurasia live in their ancient homeland, the Land of Israel, but small pockets of Jews are still scattered across the continent and around the world. However, the Jewish people believe that the Mashiach will one day return and gather the rest of these exiles into Israel, ushering in an age of unprecedented peace and prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
