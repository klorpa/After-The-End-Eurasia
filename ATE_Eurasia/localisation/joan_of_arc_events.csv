EVTNAME_joan_1;The Joan of Arc Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_joan_1;Paris has finally been taken and is between good hands. However, there have been rumours of a warrior wandering around the duchy and claiming to be inhabited by the spirit of a mysterious legendary woman... Some claim she is inhabited by the Virgin Mary, others by Marianne herself, or even a mysterious lady that took part in a rebellion to overthrow the Parisian government a long time before the Event... The local population is in awe and has joined her banners, willing to liberate the ÃŽle de France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_joan_1;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_joan_4;Dear [Prev.GetName], I am hereby solemnly asking to join me in my campaign to liberate the Holy City of Paris by giving me your assitance, your wisdom and your troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_joan_4;An urgent matter indeed it seems... I will send a detachment right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_joan_4;I have more important matters to attend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_joan_5;The Great Jeanne has succeeded in her divine mission to liberate Paris, but the situation seems to have snowballed: indeed, she is now claiming to be the rightful ruler of a number of duchies which she wishes to liberate from heathen influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_joan_5;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
