budevent1_desc;As a pious buddhist and ruler, you often wrestle as the Buddha did in tending to the worldly endeavors and the pursuit of Enlightment. Both roles seemingly in opposites you have retired to your room for the night to contemplate. You rest upon a mat and produced a copy of the [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] and begin sifting through the myraid of sutras and wise teachings of the Buddha and his students for something that may answer your current conundrum. Your hands quiver as the dim glow of the candle drew your eyes to one sutra that seems to be the answer you seek.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

MAHAYANA_SUTRA_1;Before you lays a most auspicious sutra, you slowly mouth the words of the sutra before you:\n\n"As you just said, your love was caused by your mind and eyes but if you do not knowwhere your mind and eyes really are, you will never be able to destroy delusion. For instance, when the country is invaded by bandits, the king, before sending his soldiers to destroy them, should first know where they are. That which causes you to transmigrate without interruption, comes from defects in your mind and eyes. Now tell me where your mind and eyes are."...\nFundamentally, everything that comes and goes, that comes into being and ceases to be, is within the true nature of the Matrix of the Thus-Come One, which is the wondrous, everlasting understanding — the unmoving, all-pervading, wondrous suchness of reality.\nYou arose from your deep thought and observe your surrounding in a new light, as you reminded of this verse you recall the Buddha's myraid response of the falsehoods of perception which mars the beauty of perfected wisdom and dharma. You peacefully wonder whether as King you have let your world-weary perceptions cloud your judgement...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MAHAYANA_SUTRA_2;Before you lays a most auspicious sutra, you slowly mouth the words of the sutra before you:\n\n"Then the Venerable One said to Ananda, "Tell me, Ananda, whether some god urged you to put this question to the Buddha or whether you asked about his glorious countenance from your own wise observation." Ananda replied to the Buddha, "No god came to prompt me. I asked you about this matter of my own accord."...\n\nYou arose from your deep thought and observe your surrounding in a new light, Boddhi Ananda on his own will presented before the most auspicous the dilemma of the Compassion of Sentinent Beings. And his excellence laid before Anada the truth of Dhamma and Tathagata... of which you believe may answer at least for the time-being your personal struggle of Kingship. For a compassionate ruler rules true and in accordance to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] by respecting and honoring signs of compassion in their subject and must act to correct those who turn away compassion for the pursuit of proclaiming themselves gods of empty pleasures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MAHAYANA_SUTRA_3;Before you lays a most auspicious sutra, you slowly mouth the words of the sutra before you:\n\n"Bodhisattvas who practice, the Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore see no more obstacles in their mind, and because there are no more obstacles in their mind, they can overcome all fear, destroy all wrong perceptions and realize Perfect Nirvana... All Buddhas in the past, present and future by practicing the Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore are all capable of attaining Authentic and Perfect Enlightenment... Gate, Gate, Paragate, Parasamgate, Bodhi Svaha!"\nYou arose from your deep thought and observe your surrounding in a new light, what has gripped you was the feeling of the void of desire, the shaker of truth, fear itself. You recall the six fears as told by the Auspicious One to Anada before in view of the Venerable King of Gesar. By Purging doubt and fear one can touch to the "Heart" of Perfect Wisdom as the Thus-Gone One had in times long gone and to come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MAHAYANA_SUTRA_4;Before you lays a most auspicious sutra, you slowly mouth the words of the sutra before you:\n\n"Blessed One, I ask this of the Thus-Gone One on behalf of bodhisattvas who dwell on the levels and swiftly bring the level of buddhahood to culmination, who actualize the inconceivable perfection through skillful means, who develop with little hardship the inconceivable skill as a means to bring beings to maturity, and who practice in order to manifest wisdom that will eradicate beings' nonvirtuous qualities and foster their virtuous qualities, serve the family line of the Omniscient One, and lead countless thousands of beings to the level where one is destined for unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. Blessed One, I ask this on behalf of those who teach the path of awakening to sentient beings and bodhisattvas and who delight in the qualities of buddhahood."\nYou arose from your deep thought and observe your surrounding in a new light, you wonder whether what you were lacking was introspection of your own path to buddhahood, you stand renewed in cultivating within yourself the eight noble truths to vanquish the empty pleasures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

budevent107_desc;The Day of Vesak has arrived. It was today, over three thousand years ago, that the Buddha Sakkamuni was born. On his birth the devas descended unto the world to pay homage to the future Buddha and the Sage Asita predicted that he would reject the path of the monarch and become the Buddha of this age. Fearing this, his father walled him up with all the pleasures of the world, but the Buddha did indeed leave and became enlightened under the Bodhi Tree exactly 35 years later, for the next 35 years, he lived in Nibbana before finally passing from this and all other world spheres in his Parinibba. It is for this reason we celebrate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

budevent109_desc;As you move closer, the Bhikkhu begins to narrate the Silanisama Jataka, The Tale of the Good Friend. "Eons ago, during the time of the Buddha Kassapa, there was a pious lay disciple who embarked on a journey with his wealthy friend," he begins. As he narrates the story he embellishes it, adding jokes and quips to the performance and putting on voices for the barber before reaching their ship sinking and them being marooned."It was at that time that the Barber killed a fowl and offered some to the layman who said ‘all I need is the triple gem’ and began to meditate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
budevent113_desc;As he did so a great King of Nagas appeared before them," he raises his arms and puffs himself up in mock imitation of the spirit. He narrates how the Naga transformed himself into a ship and how a Sea Spirit was captain, but refused the rich man entry as he was not a follower of the path, to which the disciple replied "the fruits of my practice, I give them all to him." The Sea Spirit nodded and took them both home. "Keep company of the wise and pious, that is the teaching of the Buddha," finishes the story-teller.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
budevent110_title;Vessantara Jataka;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
budevent110_desc;As you approach, you hear the Bhikkhu begin the Vessantara Jataka, the Tale of Prince Vessantara. "Eons ago, during the reign of Sivi in Jetuttara in the kingdom of Sivi, the Buddha Vipassi arose in the world.  During this time, a there was born a girl called Phusati…" He narrated the death and fortunate rebirth of Phusati, her marriage to the prince of Sivi, and the birth of her son, Vessantara, a past incarnation of the Buddha.  The crowd begins to cheer at the mention of Vessantara. The Bhikkhu regales the crowd with tales of Vessantara’s generosity and makes jokes along the way, using voices and gestures with much aplomb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
budevent114_desc;He then reaches the Boddhisatta’s marriage and children, his deeds as prince, and then, to the crowd’s horror and anticipation, his exile. He delights the crowd with his characters as Vessantara gives away his remaining possessions, children, and finally his wife, then the crowd cheers as the Devas spirit them away to the heavens before finally they are triumphantly reunited upon Vessantara’s return to the kingdom and how he reigned for many years before finally taking his penultimate birth in Tushita Heaven. "Though gifts drove him into exile, the merit he acquired was by far the greater gift, this is the teaching of the Buddha.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
budevent111_title;Vidurapandita Jataka;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
budevent111_desc;As you make you way to the Bhikkhu, he begins the Vidurapandita Jataka, the Tale of the Wise Sage. "Many Ages ago, when King Dhanañjaya was reigning in Kuru, he had a wise minister by the name of Vidurapandita…" With great skill and comic sensibility, he narrates the wit of Vidurapandita before telling of the debate of the Garuda King, the Deva king, the Naga King and King Dhanañjaya over who was most virtuous, how the Garuda was restrained, the Deva chaste, the Naga gentle, and Dhanañjaya austere. Then how Vidurapandita was summoned and judged their virtues equal. The tale then took a turn for the dramatic as the Queen of the Nagas desired to hear from Vidurapandita, but knowing her husband was too mild to request he be brought before him, feigned illness saying "The only cure is the heart of Vidurapandita." Distressed, the Naga king sent his daughter to find a way to receive it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
budevent115_desc;The Bhikkhu dropped into a low tone, almost whispering, as he got to the part where the Naga princess plotted with the Yakkha Prince on how they would steal away Vidurapandita in a game of dice and how finally the Yakkha prince received him. Then, just before the Yakkha prince killed him, Vidurapandita recognized that the heart of a sage was his wisdom and that the Naga queen only wanted him to preach! The crowd laughed at the revelation and cheered as he returned to Dhanañjaya. "Not just in his life as the Buddha, but also in previous lives did he show his mastery of wit, this is the teaching of the Buddha.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
