That which causes you to transmigrate without interruption, comes from defects in your mind and eyes. Now tell me where your mind and eyes are."...\nFundamentally, everything that comes and goes, that comes into being and ceases to be, is within the true nature of the Matrix of the Thus-Come One, which is the wondrous, everlasting understanding — the unmoving, all-pervading, wondrous suchness of reality.\nYou arose from your deep thought and observe your surrounding in a new light, as you reminded of this verse you recall the Buddha's myraid response of the falsehoods of perception which mares the beauty of perfected wisdom and dharma.
