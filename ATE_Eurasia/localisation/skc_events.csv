EVTNAME_skc_1;A Solarque Reborn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_skc_1; After decades of submission under the reign of foolish heathens, the Soleil Royal faith has restored it's original splendor and luminous glory. Thanks to many worthy conquests in the name of [sun_king_cultist.GetHighGodName], the partisans of the Diable have been pushed back to lands not graced by his luminous kingship of the newly anointed Solarque.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_skc_1;Long live the Solarque!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_skc_1;That is none of our business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_skc_1;Foolish heathens, God will punish them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Soon, I am faced with the commander of guard, who has heard the tales of my skill in combat.

EVTDES2_damsel_distress_3;You have been  defeated in the duel and must ride home to your castle in shame, without rescuing [event_target:damsel_in_distress.GetTitledFirstName]. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_damsel_distress_3;My Lady! May I have your hand?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_damsel_distress_3;I will never live this down...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_unworthy_chevalier;While once you were once known for valor and virtue, your sins have become too apparent. The priests who once spoke of you as a Worthy now spit at the mention of your name. At least for now, your time in their favor is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
