EVTNAME_skc_1;A Solarque Reborn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_skc_1; After decades of submission under the reign of foolish heathens, the Soleil Royal faith has restored its original splendor and luminous glory. Thanks to many worthy conquests in the name of [sun_king_cultist.GetHighGodName], the partisans of the Diable have been pushed back to lands not graced by his luminous kingship of the newly anointed Solarque.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_skc_1;Long live the Solarque!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_skc_1;That is none of our business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_skc_1;Foolish heathens, God will punish them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_claim_sun_blood_1;Your might and majesty as the [ROOT.GetPrimaryTitles] has lead priests thorughout the [sun_king_cultist.GetName] world as a great leader blessed by [sun_king_cultist.GetHighGodName] himself. Some even wonder if you might share the blood of the blessed Sun King...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_claim_sun_blood_1;Let us investige this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_claim_sun_blood_1;This is foolish;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_claim_sun_blood_2;A pile of texts have been gathered to trace back your bloodline through the generations. The task will take weeks, and you wonder: do you lead the search youself, or pass the responsibility on to [ROOT.job_spiritual.GetName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_claim_sun_blood_2;I will do it myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_claim_sun_blood_2;[ROOT.job_spiritual.GetFirstName] will do a fine job!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_claim_sun_blood_3;After weeks of study, you have found it! A missing link tying you to a bastard son of the mighty Sun King himself! The priests and scholars of the land have all verified this ancestry. The old Capet families may seethe in private, but all true followers of [sun_king_cultist.GetHighGodName] acknowledge your claim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_claim_sun_blood_3;Praise [sun_king_cultist.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_claim_sun_blood_4;Weeks of searching and stress have lead to nothing. The threads you traced back generations, all the work of your scholars, and no connection to the Sun King to be found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_claim_sun_blood_4;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


EVTDESC_worthy_chevalier;Your valiant deeds have become known by many throughout the [chevalier.GetName] world. Many priests and kinghts have begun to speak of you in reverent tones, hailing you as a Worthy, a knight whose valor and virtues are fit for comparison to those of the Nine Worthies of Old.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_worthy_chevalier;I hope that I prove worthy of this honor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_knight_arrives_worthy;A wandering knight has arrived to my court, drawn in by the tales of my virtue and valiance. [invited_character.GetSheHeCap] claims to have traveled far and wide, searching for a liege worth following, and that [invited_character.GetSheHe] wishes to pledge [invited_character.GetHerselfHimself] to my service.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_knight_arrives_worthy;I will give you command of an army.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_bard_arrives_worthy;A wandering bard has arrived at my court, drawn in by the great tales of my valor and honor.

EVTOPTA_damsel_distress_1;Fear not, my [From.GetLordLady]! I will protect you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_damsel_distress_1;Unfortunately, I cannot offer assistance now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Soon, I am faced with the commander of guard, who has heard the tales of my skill in combat. He agrees to release [event_target:damsel_in_distress.GetTitledFirstName] if I can defeat him in a duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_damsel_distress_2;Alright then! En Garde!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_damsel_distress_2;On second thought, I better head home...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDES1_damsel_distress_3;While the duel was hard-fought, you have emerged as the victor. [event_target:damsel_in_distress.GetTitledFirstName] falls into your arms, thanking you endlessly for taking [event_target:damsel_in_distress.GetHerHim] away from this dreaded place. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDES2_damsel_distress_3;You have been defeated in the duel and must ride home to your castle in shame, without rescuing [damsel_in_distress.GetTitledFirstName]. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_damsel_distress_3;My Lady! May I have your hand?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_damsel_distress_3;You will be welcome to stay in my court;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_damsel_distress_3;I will never live this down...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_unworthy_chevalier;While once you were once known for valor and virtue, your dishonorable behavior has become too apparent. The priests who once spoke of you as a Worthy now spit at the mention of your name. At least for now, your time in their favor is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
