EVTTITLEjedinstvo7;A Hero Immortalized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjedinstvo7;[hero_person.GetDynName] lived a glorious life, truly following the example of Tito. [hero_person.GetSheHeCap] passed on [hero_person.GetDeathDate], and people have long wondered if [hero_person.GetSheHe] would be considered a hero of the Yugoslav people or not. After many worshippers graced the tomb of [hero_person.GetFirstNameWithNick], it has been popularly declared that [hero_person.GetFirstNameWithNick] as a [hero_person.Religion.GetGroupName] who has indeed been immortalized into our memories, celebrated by the people of [hero_capital.GetName] as well as by their brothers in the world as a whole.  \n\nWe can only wish to follow [hero_person.GetHerHis] example, and become worthy people in the eyes of our entire communities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAjedinstvo9;May I do a fraction of their deeds...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjedinstvo9;I can only wish to be like [hero_person.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedinstvo10;[target_burial_site.GetName] is a well known traveling spot for people wishing to see the tomb of the Hero [target_burial_site.province_hero.GetFirstName]. I have never cared much for the hero [target_burial_site.province_hero.GetFirstName] nor [offended_burial_site_owner.GetTitledFirstName], and an opportunity to grab the valuables of the tomb has offered itself. But is it worth the risk?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedinstvo10;No, I rather not offend the gods...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjedinstvo10;Perhaps I can find something of worth...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjedinstvo10_TT;Preparations to pillage the burial site begins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedinstvo11;Entering the tomb of [target_burial_site.GetName], I began to observe the surrounding guaging the amount of treasures I can plunder for my own gain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedinstvo11;I should pick a few shinies and make haste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjedinstvo11;I should plunder this tomb bare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedinstvo12;The caretakers of the tomb have caught wind of your activities and quickly wrestle you to the ground. You curse the gods for your misfortune.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedinstvo12;For shame, I've been caught!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedinstvo13;The burial site of §Y[target_burial_site.province_hero.GetFirstName]§! at [target_burial_site.GetName] has been plundered, and has been left a pile of rubble...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedinstvo14;My men have come across the burial site of some great "hero" of the pathetic [pillaged_hellenic.Religion.GetGroupName] [pillaged_hellenic.GetTitledFirstName]. This could be a chance to show them how we treat their uncivilized ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedinstvo14;Take everything of value, and leave nothing behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjedinstvo14;We are not petty like them, we will leave it be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedinstvo17;Traveling along a well kept path along the forested hills, passing by many plain cottages as you make your way to the various holy places that dot the serene hillsides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedinstvo17;Onwards I go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedinstvo18;I come across a group of travelers, who are also traveling to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName], to ask for the blessing of  [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick]. Traveling together could be beneficial and safer, though probably somewhat slower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedinstvo18_ALT_3;I come across a group of travelers, who are also traveling to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName], to ask for the blessing of  [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick]. Traveling together could be beneficial and safer, though probably somewhat slower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAjedinstvo18;Friendly company? That sounds like a nice change of pace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjedinstvo18;A proper hero forges their own path...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedinstvo19;I am suddenly met by a couple of rough looking fellows, as I proceed through the forest. The leader gives me a toothy grin and asking for "donations", for the service he and his men are doing in the forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedinstvo19;It is probably easier to just pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjedinstvo19;I will show them who needs protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedinstvo20;The days have been long, but the journey not without joy. By my own estimates, I should be halfway to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName] by now. I am not used to such long travels like these, but it has been a nice change of pace from the palace affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAjedinstvo20;I wonder what awaits me in [pilgrimage_destination.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedinstvo21;I come across a group of caravans, filled with the laughter and joy of a group of traveling bards. As day turns to night, I enjoy the company of the group. A particularly beautiful [Root.GetManWomanOpp] is teasing me, and invites me to stay the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAjedinstvo21;That sounds like a nice suggestion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjedinstvo21;What kind of [Root.GetManWoman] do you think I am?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedinstvo22;It has been a long day of traveling when I come across a burning homestead. I had hoped to find a place to stay the night, but these people are clearly in dire need of help to stop the flames from engulfing the entire place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedinstvo22;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] calls upon me to help out these poor people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjedinstvo22;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] calls upon me to continue my journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjedinstvo22;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] calls upon me to grab some valuables while they are busy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedinstvo23;The rain is pouring down and I am desperately looking for a shelter, when I come across a small simple shrine and the hut of its caretaker. The modest man welcomes me inside, hangs my soaking clothes over the fire to dry and gives me a hot meal. When he mentions that it probably will not stop raining for a couple of days, I wonder if I have time to wait for that long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedinstvo23;It is better to rest a couple of days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBjedinstvo23;A real hero would not let a bit of bad weather stop them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPjedinstvo23_TT;You start feeling ill...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedinstvo24;I find myself in [pilgrimage_destination.GetName] before I know it. It has been a long journey through the wilderness, to once more see people is a nice change. As I walk through the city streets, I compare it to my own lands, and how the people have dealt with their own challenges. I find my way to the burial site of [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetName] as quickly as possible, that is what I am here for after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedinstvo24;I wonder what the tomb will look like.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedinstvo25_A;The whole area is filled with people, looking like they come from all the different corners of the world I see another [Root.Culture.GetName] looking at me, and giving me a small nod before [Root.GetSheHeOpp] disappears in the crowd. I never knew [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick] was this popular or well known. Though it is stressful, I finally get my moment to stand in front of the gates of the tomb, and feel the shining aura of the hero who resides within.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjedinstvo25_B;There is a couple of other travelers around, but they all look relatively local to the area. I walk over to the tomb, and look upon a simple mural of the hero on the wall. as well as a stele commemorating the deeds of the hero. It has been a long journey to get to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName], and I finally get to look upon the glorious burial site of  [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjedinstvo25_C;The burial site is completely devoid of people, not a single soul to be seen. I look around for it, almost sure I am at the wrong place for a moment, and then I see the simple unmarked tomb. It looks overgrown and deserted, and I take some time to tidy the place up before I finally sit down in prayer to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. It is almost like  [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick] is here with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAjedinstvo25;I will remember this moment for the rest of my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjedinstvo25;Was... Was this it? What a disappointing end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjedinstvo25;What a journey it has been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_jd_pilgrimage;Preparing to Travel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_jd_pilgrimage_prep;The time has come for you to make a holy trek to the glorious monuments of the Partisans, the Spomeniks. \n\nBut first, you must prepare for the journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_SPOMENIK_SELECTION;Glorious Monuments of Old;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_jd40;In the days of Old the followers of the warrior-poet Tito, are said to have been numerous, a bond forged by the shared brotherhood and knowledge to reach the collective divine. But with his departure to the divine, his followers slowly diverged from his precepts, the brotherhood they once shared frayed and in the chaos of the event many partisans bravely fought for what they believe was the clear and true path that Tito laid for them. These Spomeniks as they are called are the monuments to the struggles of those partisans who fought to maintain the teachings of Titos, it is left to us to learn from their sacrifice as we forge a new path to the collective divine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
