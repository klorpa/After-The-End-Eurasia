EVTTITLEjedintsvo7;A Hero Immortalized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjedintsvo7;[hero_person.GetDynName] lived a glorious life, truly following the example of Tito. [hero_person.GetSheHeCap] passed on [hero_person.GetDeathDate], and people have long wondered if [hero_person.GetSheHe] would be considered a hero of the Yugoslav people or not. After many worshippers graced the tomb of [hero_person.GetFirstNameWithNick], it has been popularly declared that [hero_person.GetFirstNameWithNick] as a [hero_person.Religion.GetGroupName] who has indeed been immortalized into our memories, celebrated by the people of [hero_capital.GetName] as well as by their brothers in the world as a whole.  \n\nWe can only wish to follow [hero_person.GetHerHis] example, and become worthy people in the eyes of our entire communities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedintsvo7;May they rest in glorious peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedintsvo8;[hero_person.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has seen a boost in the awe strucken masses who come to see the tomb of [hero_person.GetName], local merchants are seen selling emblems bearing the symbol of this prestigous hero's lineage and house. Among the crowd a bard with a lyre is seen recanting the legendary deeds of [hero_person.GetName] to a crowd of cheering people. You observe the tomb and decide what you need to do to maintain this hero's legacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedintsvo8;This Monument should befit a hero's honor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBjedintsvo8;By [hero_person.Religion.GetGroupName], I shall donate to t as well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCjedintsvo8;This hero has done us a great service, I'll make an offering...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDjedintsvo8;Maybe I can pocket a bit of change. After all, they were born here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEjedintsvo8;People of the [local_burial_tomb.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick] lets sing their deeds!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFjedintsvo8;I pray that the hero's name will be known for many generations...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCjedintsvo9;Inspired by [hero_person.GetName], you have tried to emulate their great deeds. Many people have already begun to speak highly of you as a potential new protege of the late hero. Whether their feats of cunning or strength, the people of [hero_person.PrimaryTitle.GetName] wonder whether the spirit of the hero emunates from you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedintsvo9;May I do a fraction of their deeds...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjedintsvo9;I can only wish to be like [hero_person.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedintsvo10;[target_burial_site.GetName] is a well known traveling spot for people wishing to see the tomb of the Hero [target_burial_site.province_hero.GetFirstName]. I have never cared much for the hero [target_burial_site.province_hero.GetFirstName] nor [offended_burial_site_owner.GetTitledFirstName], and an opportunity to grab the valuables of the tomb has offered itself. But is it worth the risk?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedintsvo10;No, I rather not offend the gods...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjedintsvo10;Perhaps I can find something of worth...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjedintsvo10_TT;Preparations to pillage the burial site begins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedintsvo11;Entering the tomb of [target_burial_site.GetName], I began to observe the surrounding guaging the amount of treasures I can plunder for my own gain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedintsvo11;I should pick a few shinies and make haste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjedintsvo11;I should plunder this tomb bare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedintsvo12;The caretakers of the tomb have caught wind of your activities and quickly wrestle you to the ground. You curse the gods for your misfortune.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedintsvo12;For shame, I've been caught!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedintsvo13;The burial site of §Y[target_burial_site.province_hero.GetFirstName]§! at [target_burial_site.GetName] has been plundered, and has been left a pile of rubble...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedintsvo14;My men have come across the burial site of some great "hero" of the pathetic [pillaged_hellenic.Religion.GetGroupName] [pillaged_hellenic.GetTitledFirstName]. This could be a chance to show them how we treat their uncivilized ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedintsvo14;Take everything of value, and leave nothing behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjedintsvo14;We are not petty like them, we will leave it be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedintsvo16;I shall venture to the tomb of a local hero on my way to the holy places! Perhaps I can learn many things from their deeds, as I learn more about the divine's role in our lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedintsvo17;Traveling along a well kept path along the forested hills, passing by many plain cottages as you make your way to the various holy places that dot the serene hillsides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedintsvo17;Onwards I go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedintsvo18;I come across a group of travelers, who are also traveling to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName], to ask for the blessing of  [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick]. Traveling together could be beneficial and safer, though probably somewhat slower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjedintsvo18_ALT;I come across a group of travelers, who are also traveling to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName], to ask for the blessing of  [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick].

EVTDESCjedintsvo18_ALT_3;I come across a group of travelers, who are also traveling to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName], to ask for the blessing of  [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick]. Traveling together could be beneficial and safer, though probably somewhat slower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAjedintsvo18;Friendly company? That sounds like a nice change of pace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjedintsvo18;A proper hero forges their own path...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedintsvo19;I am suddenly met by a couple of rough looking fellows, as I proceed through the forest. The leader gives me a toothy grin and asking for "donations", for the service he and his men are doing in the forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedintsvo19;It is probably easier to just pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjedintsvo19;I will show them who needs protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedintsvo20;The days have been long, but the journey not without joy. By my own estimates, I should be halfway to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName] by now. I am not used to such long travels like these, but it has been a nice change of pace from the palace affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAjedintsvo20;I wonder what awaits me in [pilgrimage_destination.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedintsvo21;I come across a group of caravans, filled with the laughter and joy of a group of traveling bards. As day turns to night, I enjoy the company of the group. A particularly beautiful [Root.GetManWomanOpp] is teasing me, and invites me to stay the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAjedintsvo21;That sounds like a nice suggestion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjedintsvo21;What kind of [Root.GetManWoman] do you think I am?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedintsvo22;It has been a long day of traveling when I come across a burning homestead. I had hoped to find a place to stay the night, but these people are clearly in dire need of help to stop the flames from engulfing the entire place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedintsvo22;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] calls upon me to help out these poor people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjedintsvo22;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] calls upon me to continue my journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjedintsvo22;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] calls upon me to grab some valuables while they are busy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedintsvo23;The rain is pouring down and I am desperately looking for a shelter, when I come across a small simple shrine and the hut of its caretaker. The modest man welcomes me inside, hangs my soaking clothes over the fire to dry and gives me a hot meal. When he mentions that it probably will not stop raining for a couple of days, I wonder if I have time to wait for that long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedintsvo23;It is better to rest a couple of days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBjedintsvo23;A real hero would not let a bit of bad weather stop them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPjedintsvo23_TT;You start feeling ill...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedintsvo24;I find myself in [pilgrimage_destination.GetName] before I know it. It has been a long journey through the wilderness, to once more see people is a nice change. As I walk through the city streets, I compare it to my own lands, and how the people have dealt with their own challenges. I find my way to the burial site of [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetName] as quickly as possible, that is what I am here for after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedintsvo24;I wonder what the tomb will look like.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedintsvo25_A;The whole area is filled with people, looking like they come from all the different corners of the world I see another [Root.Culture.GetName] looking at me, and giving me a small nod before [Root.GetSheHeOpp] disappears in the crowd. I never knew [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick] was this popular or well known. Though it is stressful, I finally get my moment to stand in front of the gates of the tomb, and feel the shining aura of the hero who resides within.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjedintsvo25_B;There is a couple of other travelers around, but they all look relatively local to the area. I walk over to the tomb, and look upon a simple mural of the hero on the wall. as well as a stele commemorating the deeds of the hero. It has been a long journey to get to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName], and I finally get to look upon the glorious burial site of  [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjedintsvo25_C;The burial site is completely devoid of people, not a single soul to be seen. I look around for it, almost sure I am at the wrong place for a moment, and then I see the simple unmarked tomb. It looks overgrown and deserted, and I take some time to tidy the place up before I finally sit down in prayer to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. It is almost like  [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick] is here with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAjedintsvo25;I will remember this moment for the rest of my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjedintsvo25;Was... Was this it? What a disappointing end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjedintsvo25;What a journey it has been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjedintsvo26;Your trip to the tomb has come to an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjedintsvo26;It was a good journey...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
