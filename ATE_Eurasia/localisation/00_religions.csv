high_church_DESC;Anglicanism describes itself as being a "via media", or middle way, between Protestantism and the Catholic Church. Following the Event, the highest authority in Anglicanism is the Archbishop of Canterbury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
free_church;Free Church;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
free_church_DESC;The Free Churches (Or Nonconformists) are derived from British protestant groups that rejected the authority of the Anglican church after the event. While descended from diverse groups which banded together to survive the post-cataclysm world, the Free Churches share a common belief in the rejection of religious hierarchy, in religious freedom and some degree of pacifism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
insular;Insular;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
insular_DESC;The catholic church in Britain and Ireland has since the event drifted from central authority in Rome. As such authority is now invested in the individual archbishops and each diosceses has its own local customs and even saints without a centralised authority to maintain theological unity. In the realm of Ireland, the Scheme on the Rights of the Church and Clergy passed by King Cormac Lí and the Dáil Éireann made the church in Ireland in particular more attached to the nation than to the pope in Rome, leading to some calling it the ‘Celtic church’ owing to influences from the pre-event ‘Ancient British Church’ and the legend of Saint Paul in Britain, lending catholicism in this area a more nationalistic and romanticist outlook than its mainland cousins.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
penitants;Penitants;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
penitants_DESC;"Repent ye and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit"/n The Penitants arose as a fervorous movement after the Event who preach gospels about Jesus sacrifice upon the crucifix. Proclaiming that while Jesus's sacrifice for mankind is noble, the world was not forgiven for its sin and that everyman from the poorest beggars to great kings must live as Jesus did modest and true to God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lutheran;Lutheran;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lutheran_DESC;“A mighty fortress is our God, A bulwark never failing.” The Lutheran Churches lost many things due to the event, but not their faith. Leading back to Martin Luther, the different churches are mostly united by the four soli: Sola fide, Sola Gratia, Solus Christus and Sola scriptura. This includes Lutheran, United, Reformed, Protestant and other Evangelical Churches. Despite there being a number of theological differences between them, they are united in their defence against the new faiths and their belief in Jesus Christ.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
laestadian;Laestadian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mariavite;Mariavite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mariavite_DESC;Mariavite Catholic Church traces its roots to Maria Franciszka, a pre-Event Polish noblewoman and visionary. It is said that during the tumultuous times of the End, She swayed Jezus to give the world another chance, and descended from Heavens to aid mankind with miracles and counsel. As Rome was lost to the infidels and the world collapsed into barbarity, monks and zealots preached the need to return into simple life of Marya of Nazareth, the Mother of God, and Maria Franciszka, the Bride of Christ.\nAs the age of strife finally came to an end and the new Roman Pope's legate safely moved past pagan lands to reach Central Europe, he was shocked to find out that the Primas who greeted him was a woman. His refusal to negotiate with who he saw as illegitimate in apostolic succession, a "pagan in bishop's robes", cemented the new schism within Christianity. For the ages to come, Mariavite Church would follow its own path under the patronage of Visegradian and Europan emperors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

orthodox;Orthodox;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orthodox_DESC;After the event, the fractured church nearly schismed over issues of succession.  Following this, Patriarchs Nicodemus of Constantinople, Mihai of Romania, and Sergey of Moscow as well as Sephirot, Archbishop of Athens, convened an eccumenical council to decided the emerging theological and practical disputes that had emerged over the centuries of separation and chaos following the event. Rome was considered “in the Jurisdiction of the autonomous church of Rome” it was replaced by Moscow, in addition, the Greek Church would fall under the Jurisdiction of the Eccumenical Patriarchate.  Furthermore, they affirmed the practice of Hesychasm and noted that the ultimate goal of the devout was Theosis, the ultimate union with the divine Christ through intimate knowledge of salvation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
catholic;Catholic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
catholic_DESC;Catholicism is one of the oldest branches of Christianity, and it survived the cataclysmic events of centuries past by the skin of its teeth. As always the formal head of the religion is the Bishop of Rome - the Pope. After the Deluge, the Papal authority of Rome was force to step out of merely being a spiritual head of the faith but also a leader for the many Catholics of the Old Continent. The Post-Antediluvian Popes in the centuries since have reestablish the Papal States to better maintain and prevent the core of the Catholic World from slipping away to the whims of Anti-Popes and Heathens. While it has lost touch with its branches outside of Europe, legates once more hope to sail outwards so that the Catholic Church may once more be a "Universal Church" for its wayward devoutees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
####Muslim####
ruhi;Ruh'i;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ruhi_DESC;The Ruh'i School was founded on the principles of exploration of faith outside the strict adherence to traditional norms generally accepted among other Sunni schools of Jurisprudence. Instead believing that an examination of other faith's traditions can enrich the experience of being a Pious Muslim. As a result they do not wish to impose GHAZI upon unbelievers. Believers of this school contend that the inward Focus of Nizami on strictly adhering to ancient traditions and Muslim Brotherhood makes them unflexible in sea of great Changes sweeping across the Stagnant old Continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nizami;Nizami;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nizami_DESC;The Nizami School has developed to be an inward facing perfection but still cosmopolitan stance of Sunni Jurisprudence (like Ruh'i). Nizami Believers Believe the importance in strengthening the bonds between brothers of the Faith and conducting themselves by the ancient Fatwas and traditions that have upheld Islam through the darkness of the Event. A solid foundation they believe is the root of Faith. Emphasizing Islamic Unity they uphold the legendary tolerance of the Old Caliphs as people to aspire to emulate. The encroaching tide of Change endangering the great legacy of Old.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sunni;Majlisi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sunni_DESC;Ash'ari, the Foremost school of Sunni Islam, has survived the event as it has every challenge it had faced before. Founded long ago by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari who preached the oneness of God Almighty in every moment and matter in the universe. His ancient school staunchly rejects that Bila Kayf, unapparent meaning, in God's word as an assumption of blind faith or taqlid. Regardless Asharites see God's judgement as always just and his reason while masked to humanity ulimately good. A common hallmark of this school is its adherence commiting to tirelessly to studying and discussing the ancient words of the Quran and the Hadiths of the prophet Muhammad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

salafi;Salafi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
salafi_DESC;A so called “Return to Tradition” they like Wahabbi dogmatically approach Islam with the ideas of “returning” to the sense of Purity and success of the Early Muslim expansions since the life of the Prophet Muhammad. This is achieved by believing the Quran alone can suffice understand and that (some adherence) do not recognize taqliqh and vehemently disapproves of the concept of Islamic Saints and their veneration. Considered extremely conservative by other branches of Sunni and the wider Islamic World they seek to return it to a pure existence unpolluted by interpretation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wahhabi;Wahhabi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wahhabi_DESC;The Oldest of the schools of Conservative Sunni Islam thought they uphold the general Salafi views of literalist interpretations of the Quran and are mistrustful of the Madhi and other jurisprudence of Islamic Law as forms of “intrepretation” of god’s uncorrupted reason. Proclaiming Tawhid (Devotion) to the one God all that is necessary against the sea of idolatry against the Oneness of God Almighty. As such also viewing bid'ah (Change) with great suspicion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ismaili;Isma'ili;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ismaili_DESC;One of the ancient schools of Shia Islam, The Ismailite Imam descend from the line of Muhammad ibn Isma'il said to have entered occultation until the coming day of judgement to lead his people in the name of god. Ismailte seek to study God Almighty through the examination of Batin (inward self) and Zahir (outward self). And thus have a long tradition of Ta'wil (elucidate) the meaning of the Quran as an allegory. This approach being an attempt to find greater hidden meaning to uplift both aspects of the soul to higher spirituality with God Almighty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zaydi;Zaydi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zaydi_DESC;Zaidiyyah, otherwise known as Fivers, is the oldest branch of Shia Islam born from the martyrdom of Zaid who revolted against the unjust rule of the Umayyad Caliph Hisam ibn Abd al-Malik. They believe that imamate succession fell upon the Zaid line but are much less strigent on the matter of Ummah succession as they do not believe in the infalliablity of heriditary succession of the Ummah. That being that it should not be limited to direct father to son succession as it is in other Shia Schools. In all Zaydi contend in humanity's responsiblity to carry out justice in the witness of God as they believe Zaid did when he rose against the wicked Caliph.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shiite;Ithna'ashariyya;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shiite_DESC;Twelver Shia Muslims believe the Twelve Imams from Ali to Madhi were all divinely ordained leaders who carry the Prophet Muhammad infalliable essence of Hikmah (Knowlege) of Islamic Law and Juriprudence. They await the return of Imam Madhi from Occulation to join faithful muslims upon the battlefield against the terrible Dajjal at the end times. They hold that only the Imam descended from the lineage of the prophet may hold the esteem office of the Ummah. A belief that share with other Shia Schools is the belief in the balance of Batin and Zahir (The Inner and Other Self).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ibadi;Ibadi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ibadi_DESC;Ibadi Muslim hold themselves apart from the wider Sunni and Shia Rivalry positioning themselves in their local communities as elected imams. Emphasizing the actions of the learnt nature of an Imam as an important pillar of their communities. Whether sworn to secrecy, exchanging their life to the divine, ruling the Sultanate, or fighting to defend their community the imam are beholden to their people as much as any ruler in any realm and can be relieved of their assign duties. As they themselves are simply Custodians of their community.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
revivalist;Revivalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
revivalist_DESC;Whilst much of the Ummah saw the Event as a test by God, the Revivalist sect saw it in a very different light. The Event was no test-- it was a reckoning, a punishment from God for the sins of society. Ostracized from the Traditionalist community, the Revivalists believed the only way to "revive" society and lift God's punishment was to cleanse sin and heresy from this world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

haredi;Haredi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
haredi_DESC;Since the time before the Event, Haredi Jews have attempted to preserve what they believe is the correct form of Judaism by isolating themselves in tight-knit, insular communities. Haredi men in all parts of society dedicate much of their time to the study of Torah and Talmud, from youth until old age. After the event, many Haredi pilgrims began to resettle in the old country, building communities near the graves of Tzaddiks. Whether living in exile or in the chaos of the holy land, Haredim still patiently await the arrival of the Moshiach, who will, even though he tarries, gather the exiles, and restore the Promised Land and Holy Temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
haskalah;Haskalah;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
haskalah_DESC;The Haskalah (lit. Enlightenment) Movement first emerged before the Event, and its ideals have managed to persist among Jewish communities throughout the centuries. While opinions differ between the various denominations on approaches to Halakha (Jewish Religious Law), all permit women to be ordained as rabbis and allow marriage between same-sex couples. The Jews of the Haskalah maintain that individual Jews should work towards restoring the pre-Event world through good works and philanthropy. This principle is known as "Tikkun Olam"-- literally, "repair of the world".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ivri;Ichud Ha'Ivrim;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ivri_DESC;Long ago the Jews of Israel were cast across the world by a great exile, greater even then the one described in the Torah. But it was said in the final throes of humanity before the event, the long exile was ended and all of Jews across their scattered communities and traditions returned to Israel to rebuild what was once lost. These are the origins for the people who now call themselves Ha'Ivrim. Standing in a precarious situation once more with the constant turmoil of squabbling warlords, they choose to rally behind the great tradition of debate and the persistent spirit of all Jews to face the challenges that have laid before them, with both the knowledge of Torah and of the outside world to guide them. No matter which rites or traditions they may follow, they are ultimately at the end striving to live by God's Commandments.

Through the emanation of the Heavenly Sovereign, he was born to a Virgin Queen. Jesus's benevolence as sovereign of the Kingdom of Heaven is a tale much lauded by believer of his divine kingship. Believing that to rule one must follow the example of Jesus the Lord, as did the Sun King of Man did so long ago. Many lords who still uphold the legendary fundamentals seek to restore the cosmic right, The Radiant Lord of the Universe intended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chevalier;Chevalier;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chevalier_DESC;After the first Sun King declared to his followers that he was an heir to not just the Kings of old but Jesus himself, his closest companion, Le Bon Chevalier, left in disgust, with half of their knights. These knights were the first generation of the Chevaliers. They hold close their code of chivalry, claiming that it is deeds and virtue, not blood that makes one worthy to rule in the eyes of God. The Chevaliers seek to follow the ways of the Nine Worthies of old, the great knights and rulers blessed by God himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
folketro;Folketro;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
folketro_DESC;Folketro, or Folk Faith, is the native religion of Scandinavia, an amalgation of Lutheranism and Nordic folklore. It is naturally viewed with suspicion by the Christian world due to its rather unorthodox belief system, such as venerating the "Hidden Folk", local spirits and supernatural beings. They view the Event as the fabled Ragnarok, which destroyed much of the Old World in a cataclysmic war between the Old Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fornsed;Forn Sed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fornsed_DESC;The Forn Sed faith is a branch of the Folketro Tradition which focuses on veneration of saints, Jesus and God than folkloric beings like Askeladden. A great trio of mighty saints stand as the foremost entities of Forn Sed belief, save God and Jesus; Sankte Per, the gatekeeper of heaven, who sends the unworthy to where the Mountain King dines with the Devil. Santa Lucia, the maiden of light whose bright flames made the great darkness which the Event brought a little more bearable. Sankt Olav, the eternal king who sent trolls north-and-down with his silver axe and golden lion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

bahai;Bahá'í;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bahai_DESC;Baha'i's descend from the Universalist movement of the prophet Bab and his successor Bahá'u'lláh.  They believe that all religions are essentially one and that God had sent messengers to the world, known as "manifestations of god" to spread his teachings.  These prophets were given the message of god to spread to each people according to their need, however over time a new prophet was needed to correct the mistakes of their followers, leading up to Bahá'u'lláh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

yazidi_DESC;The Êzîdîs are a syncretic sect of Zoroastrianism, Gnosticism, Iranic religion, and Islam who live on the fringes of Islamic society.

alawi_DESC;A secretive and syncretic faith, the Alawi have long lived in small communities in the Levant.  They originate from the disciple Ibn Nusayr as a continuation of Twelver Shi'ite thought, but beyond that, much of their practices are unkown. They believe in the one God - who some allege manifests as triad - and are alleged to partake in a communion-like ritual to obtain his transubstantiated essence. They are also believed to accept reincarnation, allegedy believing that they were originally the souls of the stars and must incarnated in human form to once again join the divine as formless souls in the heavens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

neuhumanist;Neuhumanist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
neuhumanist_DESC;Neuhumanism holds a belief in the Creator, who is revealed by the application of reason and philosophy, and the capability of human beings to know and understand Truth. It looks back to the fabled time of Enlightenment as the high point man’s intellect, when the closest was delved to the Deity’s intellect. While maintaining many Abrahamic roots, their deistic view on the Creator and its openness to any school of thought that adheres to its Five Maxims has distanced it from the Abrahamic faiths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
valinorism;Valinorism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
valinorism_DESC;In the passing of the Ages, much truth is lost to fate and misfortune and many things that should not be forgotten are. But by chance or design, they may be sung into the world once more. Valinorism is based on a rediscovered holy text called the Silmarillion. Founded from the ruins of Oxford, Valinorists believe in a detailed history, order of gods, and spirituality which is seemingly divorced from the other religions of Britain. With their henotheistic reverence of the fourteen Powers and the All-Father, fascination with craft and creation, and almost welcoming view of death, they have long stood apart from more established pre-Fall faiths. Though much reduced from their temporal height in Britain, Valinorist realms still cling on to the shores of the Irish Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

glorian_DESC;Old Albion fell harder than most, her institutions and cities were completely swallowed in the madness of the Event. By the time the potentates of Britain organized and got back on their feet little was left of the old civilization. In the face of this spiritual vacuum they fell back on the fragments still known and recorded of Old Albion. In those ancient days there were great theologians, mystic-princes, bards that enchanted all of Europe, and ruling over them all was a wise and faultless Virgin Queen who shielded her people from all harm. Rulers and covens of scholar-priests still pay homage to the Prime Minister and the Two High-Houses of Parliament gathered around the empty throne. Many pray for an end to the long interregnum, and the return of the once and future Queen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

But then came the Event, and the Republic shattered, lost to the tyranny and perfidy of those who sought to cast her down. To this day, the Jacobin folk live and revere the memory of the world-that-was, steadfastly clinging to memories of a time long bygone and hoping that the utopia of the old world shall one day come to life again. But just as the Old Republic was built at swordpoint and watered with the blood of tyrants, mayhaps it is time for the people to rise again and restore just and virtuous rule once more…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
