free_church;Free Church;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
free_church_DESC;The Free Churches (Or Nonconformists) are derived from British protestant groups that rejected the authority of the Anglican church after the event. While descended from diverse groups which banded together to survive the post-cataclysm world, the Free Churches share a common belief in the rejection of religious hierarchy, in religious freedom and some degree of pacifism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lutheran;Lutheran;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lutheran_DESC;A mighty fortress is our God, A bulwark never failing. The Lutheran Churches lost many things due to the event, but not their faith. Leading back to Martin Luther, the churches are united by the four soli: Sola fide, Sola Gratia, Solus Christus and Sola scriptura. This includes mostly Lutherans themselves as well as few other Evangelicals, most of them either led by a Synod or a Bishop. Despite them losing some ground, they stand steadfast in their defence against the new faiths and their belief in Jesus Christ.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

mariavite;Mariavite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mariavite_DESC;The Mariavite Catholic Church traces its roots to Maria Franciszka, a pre-Event Polish noblewoman and visionary. It is said that during the tumultuous times of the End, she swayed Jezus to give the world another chance, and descended from the Heavens to aid mankind with miracles and counsel. As Rome was lost to the infidels and the world collapsed into barbarity, monks and zealots preached the need to return into simple life of Marya of Nazareth, the Mother of God, and Maria Franciszka, the Bride of Christ.\nAs the age of strife finally came to an end and the new Roman Pope's legate safely moved past pagan lands to reach Central Europe, he was shocked to find out that the Primas who greeted him was a woman. His refusal to negotiate with who he saw as illegitimate in apostolic succession, a "pagan in bishop's robes", cemented the new schism within Christianity. For the ages to come, the Mariavite Church would follow its own path under the patronage of Visegradian and Europan emperors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
coronite;Coronite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
coronite_DESC;A tradition holds that Pope Sylvester II created a holy relic Sacra Corona, a crown with three pieces of the True Cross. While the crafty pope originally intended the item to be a gift for Polish duke Boleslaus the Brave, an angelic apparition convinced him to give it to King Stephen of Hungary instead. Upon his deathbed, the holy king raised the Crown as an offering to Virgin Mary, who in turn imbued It with a part of Her divine presence. From now on, Sacra Corona would be viewed as a conduit of Godly powers and embodiment of the Realm only Its wearer is worthy of suzerainty, and even crowned the ruler is still inferior to the Crown Itself. The theology around Sacra Corona was promoted by Visegradian Emperors and their court chaplains, the Grand Primases of Esztergom. While at first gaining some popularity amongst bishops who refused teachings of Maria Francesca, the Coronite Church was betrayed by no other than the Crown wearers themselves. \n Following the folk uprisings in the north, Emperor Sándor the Schismatic officially recognised the She-Bishop of Plock as the head of Christian faithful and renounced Coronite theology as idolatrous. The remaining Coronites believe that the tragedies touching the Empire in following decades were just divine punishment for illegitimate rulers who had dared to lift themselves above the Crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
oasite;Oasite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
oasite_DESC;Oasites are a radical reformation movement whose members claim that the mainstream Mariavites and Coronites betrayed Maria Francesca centuries ago, choosing the comfort of old ways over true salvation. Oasite faithful distaste war and refuse yielding to metropolitan bishops, believing that every Christian man and woman is consecrated through Baptism and shall follow Jesus's way of peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
oasite_FEATURES;§Y*§! Homosexual Oasite rulers are allowed to marry other homosexual characters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
calvinist;Reformed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
calvinist_DESC;Being descended from the Protestant Reformation and Reformators like John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli, John Knox and several others, these Christians focus on the Bible alone. Sacraments like Eucharist are seen as merely symbolic. This, together with the theological concept of Predestination in some Reformed Churches, makes ecumenical cooperation with many of their Christian Brethren difficult, despite them sharing the four Sola with the Lutherans. Nonetheless, they hold their beliefs with a deep conviction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orthodoxOrthodox;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orthodox_DESC;After the event, the fractured church nearly schismed over issues of succession. Following this, Patriarchs Nicodemus of Constantinople, Mihai of Romania, and Sergey of Moscow as well as Sephirot, Archbishop of Athens, convened an eccumenical council to decided the emerging theological and practical disputes that had emerged over the centuries of separation and chaos following the event. Rome was considered "in the Jurisdiction of the autonomous church of Rome" it was replaced by Moscow, in addition, the Greek Church would fall under the Jurisdiction of the Eccumenical Patriarchate. Furthermore, they affirmed the practice of Hesychasm and noted that the ultimate goal of the devout was Theosis, the ultimate union with the divine Christ through intimate knowledge of salvation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

They have few organized priests, instead favouring congregational attitudes leading to comparisons between them and German Anabaptist groups such as the Mennonites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dove;Dove;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dove_DESC;The Doves believe that original sin tainted the body irreparably, giving rise to the most grevious of sins, lust.  To combat this and be closer to God, they undertake acts of extreme austerity and self-harm.  The most faithful of the community become the perfects by taking the greater seal, the removal of genitals and breasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
catholic;Catholic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
catholic_DESC;Catholicism is one of the oldest branches of Christianity, and it survived the cataclysmic events of centuries past by the skin of its teeth. As always the formal head of the religion is the Bishop of Rome - the Pope. After the Deluge, the Papal authority of Rome was force to step out of merely being a spiritual head of the faith but also a leader for the many Catholics of the Old Continent. The Post-Antediluvian Popes in the centuries since have reestablish the Papal States to better maintain and prevent the core of the Catholic World from slipping away to the whims of Anti-Popes and Heathens. Standing upon a new foundation, the church once more looks outwards in hopes of restoring contact and mending its ties with its wayward devoutee at home and in distant lands so that once more like in the days of Old, the Church can truly be a "Universal Church".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apparitionist;Apparitionist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apparitionist_DESC;Termed 'Apparitionists' by those who frown upon them, these Marian devotees have elevated esctasies and divine visions to the level of dogma. Believing each new revelation makes the light of faith shine brighter, ecstacies, visions, and possessions are common among the Apparitionists, and even expected of their rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

nasrani_DESC;The Christians of St. Thomas are the oldest in India, tracing their lineage back to the disciple Thomas and his missions to India, they hold themselves to have an unbroken apostolic lineage to Christ himself. After the event, they were united by a council of the various Archbishops the St. Thomas Christian sects as well as those from Goa and Mumbai to form the current church which is united in using the East Syriac Rite and an official Christology that recognizes both Hypostasis and Theopaschitism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ezharapallikal;Ezharapallikal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ezharapallikal_DESC;Tracing their descent to the same journey of Thomas, the Ezharapallikals set themselves apart from the Nasrani by their move towards folk practices and lack of ecclesiastic hierarchy. Furthermore, they believe that the bible is corrupted, favoring the Devotional songs of Thomas passed down by their forbearers. They are Docetists and Gnostics, believing that Christ could not be merely a man and god incarnate as humanity is corruptible and prone to sin. Thus for Christ to be entirely pure, he must have not possessed a material existence.  They seek union with Christ and removal from material existence entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
insular;Insular;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
insular_DESC;As the Papacy in Rome retreated to the shadowy recess as the Event Sundered old Rome until nothing but ash coated its once mighty streets, the periphery of the Catholic World had to fend for themselves to protect their monasteries and parishes from perishing before a new age of religious strife unseen in Christendom since the times of Old. Isolated by the cruel march of time, even as the Vicar of Rome returned into public life and Rome Rebuilt upon St.Peter's Rock, Those few that remain hesistant to once more fall within communion with Rome hold that it is best that in this new and uncertain world that one's local parish is more important then relying on the promises of a distant patriarch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
penitant;Capirote;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
penitant_DESC;"Dime, pecador si en gracia no estás cuando Dios te llama a su tribunal. Tu seno de culpas allí se verá y aun las más ocultas, patentes serán."\nBranching off from the Insular movement in recent years, the Capirotes believe in constant and extreme mortification and self-denial, as penance for the Event. The Capirotes are ruled by the Sacerdote de la Sangre, who is elected by a council of fraternities and charged with protecting the faithful. Through penance and most holy suffering, they may yet restore the church to it's Antediluvian glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

miaphysite_DESC;The United Oriental Apostolic Church traces its origin in a union between the five miaphysite churches of the East: the Coptic Church, the Tewahedo Church of Ethiopia, the Tewahedo Church of Eritrea, the Syriac Orthodox Church, and the Armenian Apostolic Church. During the Council of Sawhaj in 2381 the six churches were made into one under the guidance of the Emperors of Egypt and Ethiopia. The Apostolics are Miaphysite, believing Christ to have one nature where both the divine and human are united. At the resolution of the council, the Presbyterates of Alexandria, Axum, Marseille, Etchmiadzin, and Antioch were raised. The Apostolics put great emphasis on the Cenobitic system established by Saint Pachomius the Great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pentay;P'ent'ay;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pentay_DESC;The Reformed Church of the East is a loose confederation of churches who while disagreeing among themselves are a united voice seeking to reform various aspects of the Churches of the East. Self ascribed as Evangelicals and Pentecostal, they seek to devest supreme church authority away from the Patriarches to the hands of local bishops. Theologically significant to their belief in the spirtual cleansing and rebirth of the spirit via the Holy Spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pravoslavie;Pravoslavie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pravoslavie_DESC;As the deluge upended the old order, the distant northern Patriarch of Moscow, the Patriarch of all Russia stood as a beacon of hope in the darkness. As the dark age of disunity came to an end a great ecumenical council of the East was convened which affirmed the standing practice of Hesychasm and the ultimate goal of the devout was Theosis. While this council established the elevated position of Moscow in place of Rome, the successors of Sergey did not believe the council went far enough to recognize the contributions of Moscow to the furtherment of the Church. This bitterness eventually sundered the Church as like Rome, the Autonomous Church in Moscow was established dividing the Orthodox World once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dvoeverie;Dvoeverie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dvoeverie_DESC;Far from the opulent centers of the Patriarkh's authority, the small folk of Russia hold to the veneration of ancient saints who are said to protect the spirutal heart of All-Russia. Adorning their small hamlets with icons of the blessed saints, they believe the Event was a punishment sent by God for the sins of the Old World. They believe that the Patriarkh has long disregarded the spiritual needs of All-Russia and thus took it upon themselves to call upon the saints to intercede with God so they can reach Theosis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ruhi;Ruh'i;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ruhi_DESC;The Ruh'i School was founded on the principles of exploration of faith outside the strict adherence to traditional norms generally accepted among other Sunni schools of Jurisprudence. Instead believing that an examination of other faith's traditions can enrich the experience of being a pious Muslim. As a result they do not wish to impose ghazi upon unbelievers. Believers of this school contend that the inward Focus of Nizami on strictly adhering to ancient traditions and Muslim brotherhood makes them unflexible in sea of great changes sweeping across the stagnant old continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temple_baron_ruhi;Imam;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alevi;Alevi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alevi_DESC;Alevis are the followers of the doctrine of Hajji Bektash Veli. Alevism is an esoteric and mystical interpretation of Islam venerating a trinity composed of Muhammad, Al-Haqq and Ali (Al Haqq being Allah, at the center of the trinity). Allah is the supreme judge and perceiver, omnipotent, omniscient and merciful. The fundamental religious doctrine of the Alevis is the duality between Esoteric (iç yüzü) and Exoteric (zahir). The duality is at the center of the Qurans interpretation and of the world itself. To them, though the Quran is the initiatory path which passes through the four narrow doors of knowledge to reach God-Reality, the choice of the course is a matter of method.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

naqshbandi;Naqshbandi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
naqshbandi_DESC;The Nizami School has developed towards an inward facing, perfectionist, but still cosmopolitan stance of Sunni jurisprudence (like Ruh'i). Nizami adherants believe the importance in strengthening the bonds between brothers of the Faith and conducting themselves by the ancient Fatwas and traditions that have upheld Islam through the darkness of the Event. A solid foundation they believe is the root of Faith. Emphasizing Islamic unity, they uphold the legendary tolerance of the Old Caliphs as people to aspire to emulate, while protecting the great legacy of Old threatened by the tide of Change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

sunni;Majlisi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sunni_DESC;Following the Disaster, the larger Sunni world plunged into chaos as the new age of strife set brother against brother, creed against creed, and madrasah against madrasah. It was through the rise of the Empire in Egypt, and the active work of multiple scholars, that a semblance of order was once more restored to the now fractured world of competing schools of thought. Holding to the old madhhabs and the lessons of the four wise imams, the Majlisi folk - so named because of their taking fatwa from the Majlis in Al-Azhar - trust and follow in God's ultimate justice for the good of humanity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ahl_as_salaf;Ahl as-Salaf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ahl_as_salaf_DESC;The oldest of the schools of conservative Sunni Islam thought they uphold the general Salafi views of literalist interpretations of the Quran and are mistrustful of the Madhi and other jurisprudence of Islamic Law as forms of "intrepretation" of god's uncorrupted reason.

zaydi;Zaydi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zaydi_DESC;Zaidiyyah, otherwise known as Fivers, is the oldest branch of Shia Islam born from the martyrdom of Zaid who revolted against the unjust rule of the Umayyad Caliph Hisam ibn Abd al-Malik. They believe that imamate succession fell upon the Zaid line but are much less strigent on the matter of Ummah succession as they do not believe in the infalliablity of heriditary succession of the Ummah. That being that it should not be limited to direct father to son succession as it is in other Shia Schools. In all Zaydi contend in humanity's responsiblity to carry out justice in the witness of God as they believe Zaid did when he rose against the wicked Caliph.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shiite;Ithna'ashariyya;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shiite_DESC;Twelver Shia Muslims believe the Twelve Imams from Ali to Madhi were all divinely ordained leaders who carry the Prophet Muhammad infalliable essence of Hikmah (Knowlege) of Islamic Law and Juriprudence.

ibadi;Ibadi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ibadi_DESC;Ibadi Muslim hold themselves apart from the wider Sunni and Shia Rivalry positioning themselves in their local communities as elected imams. Emphasizing the actions of the learnt nature of an Imam as an important pillar of their communities. Whether sworn to secrecy, exchanging their life to the divine, ruling the Sultanate, or fighting to defend their community the imam are beholden to their people as much as any ruler in any realm and can be relieved of their assign duties. As they themselves are simply Custodians of their community.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
revivalist;Revivalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
revivalist_DESC;Whilst much of the Ummah saw the Event as a test by God, the Revivalist sect saw it in a very different light. The Event was no test-- it was a reckoning, a punishment from God for the sins of society. Ostracized from the Traditionalist community, the Revivalists believed the only way to "revive" society and lift God's punishment was to cleanse sin and heresy from this world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
taharur;Taharuri;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
taharur_DESC;We are people that will not surrender, we win or we die. These words were spoken by the wise Lion of the Desert, who objected to the sectarian divisions plaguing the Ummah, instead seeking the path of liberation.

sunnah;Ahlus Sunnah;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sunnah_DESC;Before the Disaster, the last Khilafa' ended in treachery and foreign domination. Though many claimed the title of Caliph since those days, none were truly recognized. Following the Reconciliation Council, a new Caliph was declared as a unifying head to the Sunni movements of the Post-Disaster world. Through long discussions of reconcilation and compromise this unified front has collectively been referred to as the "Ahl-al Sunnah" movement, striving to uphold the three promises of tradition, brotherhood, and truthfulness. Engrained in these promises are the understanding that by tradition one can recover what has been lost and strengthen what exists, by brotherhood one could stand together as cohesive front and prevent another collapse of the Muslim world, and by truthfulness one is able to navigate a world vastly changed by the Disaster while remaining true to the universal truth - One God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hui;Huízú;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hui_DESC;Huíjiào, the religion of the Hui, represents a cultural understanding of the essence of Islam - Truth and Purity, as sublime characteristics of the One God. A defining difference that sets them apart from other Muslims is their veneration of the sage wisdoms of Kongzhi and their adoption of many Chinese customs. The traditions of Islamic thought live on through the scholarly muses of Ma Scholars who, like their Confucian peers, believe in the orderly dispension of Heaven to be paramount.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
barelvi;Barelvi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
barelvi_DESC;The Barelvis are a sufi-oriented strain of Indian Islam who believe firmly in sufistic concepts such as the "light of Muhammad," the doctrine that Muhammad was one of Gods first creation, given form upon his birth and that he now exists as a formless light to work under Gods direction and intercede on the behalf of Muslims around the world simultaneously. They believe firmly in the efficacy of Muslim saints and the chanting of Dhikr. This sets them apart from other Muslim movements in the Subcontinent that firmly stand against Sufi practices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
deobandi;Deobandi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
deobandi_DESC;Deobandi are a sect of the Hanafi School from the Indian Subcontinent which strongly believes in the doctrine of taqlid in lull of mujtahid. Because of this, study of scripture is highly valued among the Deobandi and learning is placed in equal importance to mysticism and revelation, since these are believed to have long since passed and only given to the prophets. Believing through careful examination of the word, one can dispell falsehood and blind faith. While they typically eschew traditional sufi practices of groups like the Barlevis they still highly regard the chanting of the names of God, as an auspicious and pious practice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

haredi;Haredi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
haredi_DESC;Since the time before the Event, Haredi Jews have attempted to preserve what they believe is the correct form of Judaism by isolating themselves in tight-knit, insular communities. Haredi men in all parts of society dedicate much of their time to the study of Torah and Talmud, from youth until old age. After the event, many Haredi pilgrims began to resettle in the old country, building communities near the graves of Tzaddiks. Whether living in exile or in the chaos of the holy land, Haredim still patiently await the arrival of the Moshiach, who will, even though he tarries, gather the exiles, and restore the Promised Land and Holy Temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
haskalah;Haskalah;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
haskalah_DESC;The Haskalah (lit. Enlightenment) Movement first emerged before the Event, and its ideals have managed to persist among Jewish communities throughout the centuries. While opinions differ between the various denominations on approaches to Halakha (Jewish Religious Law)," all permit women to be ordained as rabbis and allow marriage between same-sex couples. The Jews of the Haskalah maintain that individual Jews should work towards restoring the pre-Event world through good works and philanthropy. This principle is known as "Tikkun Olam"-- literally, "repair of the world".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ivri_DESC;Long ago the Jews of Israel were cast across the world by a great exile, greater even then the one described in the Torah. But it was said in the final throes of humanity before the event, the long exile was ended and all of Jews across their scattered communities and traditions returned to Israel to rebuild what was once lost. These are the origins for the people who now call themselves Ha'Ivrim. Standing in a precarious situation once more with the constant turmoil of squabbling warlords, they choose to rally behind the great tradition of debate and the persistent spirit of all Jews to face the challenges that have laid before them, with both the knowledge of Torah and of the outside world to guide them. No matter which rites or traditions they may follow, they are ultimately at the end striving to live by God's Commandments.

valinorist_DESC;In the passing of the Ages, much truth is lost to fate and misfortune and many things that should not be forgotten are. But by chance or design, they may be sung into the world once more. Valinorism is based on a rediscovered holy text called the Silmarillion. Founded from the ruins of Oxford, Valinorists believe in a detailed history, order of gods, and spirituality which is seemingly divorced from the other religions of Britain. With their henotheistic reverence of the fourteen Powers and the All-Father, fascination with craft and creation, and almost welcoming view of death, they have long stood apart from more established pre-Fall faiths. Though much reduced from their temporal height in Britain, Valinorist realms still cling on to the shores of the Irish Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

By the time the potentates of Britain organized and got back on their feet little was left of the old civilization. In the face of this spiritual vacuum they fell back on the fragments still known and recorded of Old Albion. In those ancient days there were great theologians, mystic-princes, bards that enchanted all of Europe, and ruling over them all was a wise and faultless Virgin Queen who shielded her people from all harm. Rulers and covens of scholar-priests still pay homage to the Prime Minister and the Two High-Houses of Parliament gathered around the empty throne. Many pray for an end to the long interregnum, and the return of the once and future Queen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

After the event, the Sikhs banded together around the ruins of the Armristar and eventually rebuilt their empire.  Over time, the Granthi's became the only ones able to read the Sri Guru and power became increasingly collected in their hands.

After the Dalai Lama usurped the title of Gaden Tripa and solidified his primacy over the Gelugpa, the masters of all four traditions denounced him and fled through the Himalayas with thousands of their followers to the secluded Kagyu kingdom of Bhutan, for which their descendants lay waiting for their time to exact their ancient rivalry with the Gelugpa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
