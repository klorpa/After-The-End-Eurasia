high_thelema_DESC;Thelema is a British mystic religion "spiritual philosophy" developed by Aleister Crowley, based on the law: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." It is a polytheistic religion that draws its pantheon of gods from the religious beliefs of Ancient Egypt. However, their highest deity is someone - or something - known only as "The Queen".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

low_thelema_DESC;Thelema is a British mystic religion "spiritual philosophy" developed by Aleister Crowley, based on the law: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." It is a polytheistic religion that draws its pantheon of gods from the religious beliefs of Ancient Egypt. Derided as "Low Thelema" by members of the Thelema orthodoxy", Low Thelemites claim they follow the original Thelema and that the High Thelemite orthodoxy has turned away from the law of Light, Liberty, and Love in favor of Anglican tyranny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
high_church;Anglican;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
high_church_DESC;Anglicanism describes itself as being a "via media", or middle way, between Protestantism and the Catholic Church. Following the Event, the highest authority in Anglicanism is the Archbishop of Canterbury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
high_church_FEATURES; A sufficiently powerful Anglican leader can vassalize the Archbishop of Canterbury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
free_church;Free Church;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
free_church_DESC;The Free Churches (Or Nonconformists) are derived from British protestant groups that rejected the authority of the Anglican church after the event. While descended from diverse groups which banded together to survive the post-cataclysm world, the Free Churches share a common belief in the rejection of religious hierarchy, in religious freedom and some degree of pacifism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
insular;Insular;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
insular_DESC;The catholic church in Britain and Ireland has since the event drifted from central authority in Rome. As such authority is now invested in the individual archbishops and each diosceses has its own local customs and even saints without a centralised authority to maintain theological unity. In the realm of Ireland, the Scheme on the Rights of the Church and Clergy passed by King Cormac Lí and the Dáil Éireann made the church in Ireland in particular more attached to the nation than to the pope in Rome, leading to some calling it the ‘Celtic church’ owing to influences from the pre-event ‘Ancient British Church’ and the legend of Saint Paul in Britain, lending catholicism in this area a more nationalistic and romanticist outlook than its mainland cousins.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
valinorism;Valinorism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
valinorism_DESC;In the passing of the Ages, much truth is lost to fate and misfortune and many things that should not be forgotten are. But by chance or design, they may be sung into the world once more. Valinorism is based on a rediscovered holy text called the Silmarillion. Founded from the ruins of Oxford, Valinorists believe in a detailed history, order of gods, and spirituality which is seemingly divorced from the other religions of Britain. With their henotheistic reverence of the fourteen Powers and the All-Father, fascination with craft and creation, and almost welcoming view of death, they have long stood apart from more established pre-Fall faiths. Though much reduced from their temporal height in Britain, Valinorist realms still flourish in the regions of the Baltic Sea..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ichthysist;Ichthysist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ichthysist_DESC;"And Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishers). And he saith to them: Come ye after me, and I will make you to be fishers of men. And they immediately leaving their nets, followed him."/n Ichthysist is an eclectic order who took to the seas as Brendan the Voyager had long ago to follow in the teachings of the Great King of the Fishers, The lord Jesus Christ. Whose seaside teachings brought comfort to fishermen across Europe during the Dark days of the Event. It is said that Stella Maris, The Lady of the Sea, guides sailors through her guiding presence against the black sky, one day leading humanity back to Christ's Kingdom beyond the sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
penitants;Penitants;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
penitants_DESC;"Repent ye and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit"/n The Penitants arose as a fervorous movement after the Event who preach gospels about Jesus sacrifice upon the crucifix. Proclaiming that while Jesus's sacrifice for mankind is noble, the world was not forgiven for its sin and that everyman from the poorest beggars to great kings must live as Jesus did modest and true to God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jewish;Jewish;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jewish_DESC;Judaism is one of the oldest religions on the planet, and it survived the Event like it did so many other catastrophes. Although Orthodox Judaism's practices have changed relatively little over the last few centuries, the Jews of post-Event Eurasia now face discrimination and persecution on a scale unheard of since before the event. Most Jews in Eurasia live in their ancient homeland, the Land of Israel, but small pockets of Jews are still scattered across the continent and around the world. However, the Jewish people believe that the Mashiach will one day return and gather the rest of these exiles into Israel, ushering in an age of unprecedented peace and prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

jacobin_DESC;Worshipping the Goddess Marianne, almighty symbol of the sacred Res Publica and her three faces, Liberté, Egalité and Fraternité, Jacobins are in awe of what is now nothing more but a mere memory that has been lost for a long time. However, Jacobins still do not tolerate any disrespect towards la Vénérable Marianne, attempting to restore her supremacy over France, resisting the filthy heathens tryingt  to disrupt the Sacred Marianne's Grandeur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

neuhumanist;Neuhumanist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
neuhumanist_DESC;Neuhumanism holds a belief in the Creator, who is revealed by the application of reason and philosophy, and the capability of human beings to know and understand Truth. It looks back to the fabled time of Enlightenment as the high point man’s intellect, when the closest was delved to the Deity’s intellect. While maintaining many Abrahamic roots, their deistic view on the Creator and its openness to any school of thought that adheres to its Five Maxims has distanced it from the Abrahamic faiths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Through the emanation of the Heavenly Sovereign, he was born to a Virgin Queen. Jesus's benevolence as sovereign of the Kingdom of Heaven is a tale much lauded by believer of his divine kingship. Believing that to rule one must follow the example of Jesus the Lord, as did the Sun King of Man did so long ago.
