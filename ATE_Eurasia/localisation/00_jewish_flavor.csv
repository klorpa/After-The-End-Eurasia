#Tish Localizations;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLE_TISH_INVITATION;A Grand Tish;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TISH_INVITATION;To celebrate your great Rebbe [Root.job_spiritual.GetFirstName], Admor of [Root.Capital.GetName], you have decided to hold a grand tish in his honor, inviting all his disciples from far and wide to celebrate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_inform_haredi_rabbi;Let all come and honor this wise Tzaddik!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RECITING_TORAH;The Wisdom of The Rebbe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TORAH_VERSE_1;A silence fills the room as the Rebbe clears his throat and begins to share some words of wisdom: \n A disciple once asked the Baal Shem Tov: "Why is it that one who clings to God and knows he is close to him, sometimes experiences a sense of interruption and remoteness?" \n The Baal Shem explained: "When a father sets out to teach his little son to walk, he stands in front of him and holds his two hands on either side of the child, so that he cannot fall, and the boy goes toward his father between his father's hands. But the moment he is close to his father, he moves away a little, and holds his hands farther apart, and he does this over and over, so that the child may learn to walk.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TORAH_VERSE_2;A silence fills the room as the Rebbe clears his throat and begins to share some words of wisdom: \n Rabbi Pinhas of Koretz once said: "God's relationship to the wicked may be compared to that of a prince who, besides his magnificent palaces, owns all manner of little houses hidden away in the woods and in villages, and visits them occasionally to hunt or to rest. The dignity of a palace is no greater than that of such a temporary abode, for the two are not alike, and what the lesser accomplishes, the greater cannot. It is the same with the righteous man. Though his value and service be great, he cannot accomplish what the wicked man accomplishes in the hour he prays, or does something to honor God, and God who is watching the worlds of confusion, rejoices in him. That is why the righteous man should not consider himself better than the wicked.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TORAH_VERSE_3;A silence fills the room as the Rebbe clears his throat and begins to share some words of wisdom: \n Rabbi Yehiel Mikhal once said: "It is written: 'Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord? And who shall stand in His holy place?' For the sake of comparison, let us take a man who rides up a mountain in his carriage, and when he is half-way up, the horses are tired and he must stop and give them a rest. Now, whoever has no sense at this point, will roll down. But he who has sense will take a stone and put it under the wheel while the carriage is standing. Then he will be able to reach the top. The man who does not fall, when he is forced to interrupt his service, but knows how to pause, will get to the top of the mountain of the Lord.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TORAH_VERSE_4;A silence fills the room as the Rebbe clears his throat and begins to share some words of wisdom: \n Rabbi Shelomo of Karlin once said: "When he, who has done all the commandments of the Torah, but has not felt the blaze of holy ecstasy in so doing, comes to that other world, they open the gates of paradise for him. But because he has not felt the blaze of ecstasy in this world, he does not feel the ecstasy of paradise. Now, if he is a fool, and complains, and grumbles: 'And they make so much to-do about paradise!' he is instantly thrown out. But if he is wise, he leaves of his own accord, and goes to the tzaddik, and he teaches the poor soul how to feel ecstasy.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_praise_rabbi;Wise Words!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_A_NIGHT_OUT;Kol Sasson v'Kol Simcha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TISH_PARTY;Your servants bring out a sumptous feast arranged for your Rabbi and the other dignitaries on the high table: kugel filled with raisins and cinnamon, lamb tsimmes, goblets filled to the brim with wine. While many of the disciples ate their meals at home, the Rebbe passes out wine and food for each of them as shiyarim, each recieved with a personal blessing from the Rebbe. \n After the meal, the Rebbe begins with a slight voice, singing a wordless melody. Slowly his disciples begin to join in, the song building in passionate intensity as voices fill the great dining hall with music. Soon the young chassids are dancing on the tables, as their elders clap and sway in the benches!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Hitboddedut Localizations ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_hitboddedut_0;Another exhausting day at court: the weight of worldly affairs lie heavy on your shoulders. You decide to spend longer than you usually do in the woods by your castle practicing hitboddetdut, isolating yourself in the forest and speaking to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] as you would with a best friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_hitboddedut_0;Slip out of your palace and enter the woods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hitboddedut_1;You have spent so much time trying to seem sophisticated at court, and now it all seems so absurd. You are reminded in Hitboddedut of the words of Rebbe Nachman: "Sometimes, when a person gets too caught up in philosophies and sophistication, he needs to purposely free himself of his mind and do things which make him seem silly, to 'Be crazy with love'";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_hitboddedut_1;I will be crazy with love for [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hitboddedut_2;You feel awed by [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s creation, understanding how little your own so-called importance matters in comparison. A fancy title and a palace mean nothing to you in this place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_hitboddedut_2;I am humbled by this moment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hitboddedut_3;Feeling the presense of the Holy One around you, you are reminded of the Rebbe's words: "Worldly desires are like sunbeams in a dark room. They seem solid until you try to grasp one.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_hitboddedut_3;I will let go of my worldly grasping;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hitboddedut_4;In the woods, you feel a great lifting of your spirit. All worldly things that have been weighing you down seem much less important now than they were before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_hitboddedut_4;"It is a great mitzvah to be happy always.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hitboddedut_5;The words pour out of you but you still feel distant from [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. "I turn my eyes unto the mountains, from where will my help come?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_hitboddedut_5;My help will come from HaShem, in time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hitboddedut_6;You let out a silent scream, emptying your mind of all its ills. Although the road ahead may seem diificult, you remember the words of the Rebbe: "All the world is a very narrow bridge, and the most important thing is to have no fear at all.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_pale_settlement;Shaped by the oppressive decree of an ancient Tzar, the Pale of Settlement became the great center of Yiddish life in spite of the hardships. The Shtetls built in those years long ago birthed entire movements in Jewish religion and culture. Though the first flowering of Jewish life here was built under the shadow of the wicked Tzars, under [From.GetTitledName]'s reign a new rebirth of Jewish life in the pale has begun, one borne from joy rather than strife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Bar Mitzvah Localizations ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_barmitzvah_1;The day of [bar_mitzvah_target.GetBestName]'s Bar Mitzvah is soon approaching, and excitement builds in the palace. Your Rabbi [Root.job_spiritual.GetBestName] has offered to personally prepare [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHimHer] in the final month, to read from the Torah and give a D'var Torah as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_1;[Root.job_spiritual.GetBestName] will prepare my [bar_mitzvah_target.GetSonDaughter].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_barmitzvah_1;I can prepare [bar_mitzvah_target.GetBestName] for the Bar Mitzvah myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_barmitzvah_1;[bar_mitzvah_target.GetBestName] can figure it out on [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHisHer] own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDES1_barmitzvah_2;The day has arrived. At your family's synagogue [bar_mitzvah_target.GetBestName] approaches the bimah brimming with a regal confidence. [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHeShe] reads [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHisHer] Torah portion effortlessly, followed by a D'var Torah on the portion that impresses even the most cynical of your vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDES2_barmitzvah_2;The day has arrived. At your family's synagogue [bar_mitzvah_target.GetBestName] approaches the bimah shaking nervously. [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHeShe] stumbles [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHisHer] way through the passage, constantly stopping for corrections from the gabbai. Your vassals cringe in pity as [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] attempts to deliver a clumsy D'var Torah clearly written the night before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_2;I'm so proud!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_barmitzvah_2;That fool!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_barmitzvah_3;In the celebration after, you see [bar_mitzvah_target.GetBestName] and [compliment_vassal.GetBestName] discussing intently some issue brought up in [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHisHer] D'var Torah, with [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] displaying a maturity you didn't realize [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHeShe] had. Afterwards [compliment_vassal.GetFirstName] pull you aside to tell you just how impressed [compliment_vassal.GetHeShe] is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_3;That's my [bar_mitzvah_target.GetSonDaughter]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_barmitzvah_4;In the celebration after, you see [bar_mitzvah_target.GetBestName] and [insult_vassal.GetBestName] arguing, when [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] suddenly jumps up out of [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHisHer] seat, flailing at [insult_vassal.GetFirstName] until your guards are able to pull [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHimHer] away. [insult_vassal.GetFirstName] calls out to you: "is this how your family treats guests?".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_4;Ugh, what have you done [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_barmitzvah_5;It seems as if [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] has started getting along incredibly well with the child of one of the visiting vassals! Indeed, apparently [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] and [befriended_child.GetBestName] are becoming fast friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_5;How lovely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_barmitzvah_6;While having a pleasant conversation you are suddenly interrupted by an infernal ruckus, upon further investigation it seems as if [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] has gotten into a fight with the child of one of the visiting vassals! You tear the two children apart, but it is obvious that [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] and [rival_child.GetBestName] will not ever be friends after this encounter...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_6;I wonder who started it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_barmitzvah_7;As the hours go by you notice [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName]'s mood starting to drop. [bar_mitzvah_target.GetSheHeCap] is obviously still upset about the embarassment at [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHis] Bar Mitzvah. Hopefully this slump in [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName]'s mood will pass soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_7;I should go help [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_barmitzvah_8;After a long night of celebration, the Bar Mitzvah is finally over. After all the stresses of the day, [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] retires to [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHis] chambers and wishes you good night. For better or worse, you look on the child you raised, finally grown to adulthood, and wonder what [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHis] future will bring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_8;I feel old...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Passover Localizations;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_SoA_500;More than 2,000 years ago, God aided the Children of Israel in their escape from slavery by inflicting ten plagues upon ancient Egypt. The last of these saw a spirit of the Lord slay every first-born in Egypt, but 'pass over' Jewish homes marked with the blood of a slaughtered lamb. This festival celebrates the return of freedom to the enslaved Jewish people.;Il y a plus de 2 000 ans, Dieu aida les Enfants d'Israël à fuir l'esclavage en infligeant les Dix Plaies d'Égypte. Pour la dernière de ces plaies, Dieu envoya un esprit qui causa la mort de tous les premiers-nés d'Égypte, mais qui ignora les maisons des juifs car ils en avaient marqué les portes du sang d'un agneau.\nLa fête célèbre le retour à la liberté pour le peuple juif réduit à l'esclavage.;Vor über 2000 Jahren half Gott den Kindern Israels bei ihrer Flucht aus der ägyptischen Gefangenschaft, indem er Ägypten mit 10 Plagen heimsuchte. Bei der letzten Plage schickte Gott einen Geist, der jeden Erstgeborenen in Ägypten erschlug. Nur die Häuser der Israeliten, die mit dem Blut eines geopferten Lamms gekennzeichnet waren, wurden verschont. Das Pessach-Fest wird zum Gedenken an die Rückkehr der Juden in die Freiheit gefeiert.;;Hace más de 2.000 años, Dios ayudó a los Hijos de Israel a huir de la esclavitud enviando diez plagas sobre el Antiguo Egipto.
