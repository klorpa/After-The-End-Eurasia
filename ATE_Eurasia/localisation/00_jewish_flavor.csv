EVTTITLE_RECITING_TORAH;The Wisdom of The Rebbe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TORAH_VERSE_1;A silence fills the room as the Rebbe clears his throat and begins to share some words of wisdom: \n	A disciple asked the Baal Shem Tov: "Why is it that one who clings to God and knows he is close to him, sometimes experiences a sense of interruption and remoteness?" \n	The Baal Shem explained: "When a father sets out to teach his little son to walk, he stands in front of him and holds his two hands on either side of the child, so that he cannot fall, and the boy goes toward his father between his father’s hands. But the moment he is close to his father, he moves away a little, and holds his hands farther apart, and he does this over and over, so that the child may learn to walk.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TORAH_VERSE_2;A silence fills the room as the Rebbe clears his throat and begins to share some words of wisdom: \n	Rabbi Pinhas of Koretz once said: “God’s relationship to the wicked may be compared to that of a prince who, besides his magnificent palaces, owns all manner of little houses hidden away in the woods and in villages, and visits them occasionally to hunt or to rest. The dignity of a palace is no greater than that of such a temporary abode, for the two are not alike, and what the lesser accomplishes, the greater cannot. It is the same with the righteous man. Though his value and service be great, he cannot accomplish what the wicked man accomplishes in the hour he prays, or does something to honor God, and God who is watching the worlds of confusion, rejoices in him. That is why the righteous man should not consider himself better than the wicked.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TORAH_VERSE_3;A silence fills the room as the Rebbe clears his throat and begins to share some words of wisdom: \n	Rabbi Yehiel Mikhal once said: “It is written: ‘Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord? And who shall stand in His holy place?’ For the sake of comparison, let us take a man who rides up a mountain in his carriage, and when he is half-way up, the horses are tired and he must stop and give them a rest. Now, whoever has no sense at this point, will roll down. But he who has sense will take a stone and put it under the wheel while the carriage is standing. Then he will be able to reach the top. The man who does not fall, when he is forced to interrupt his service, but knows how to pause, will get to the top of the mountain of the Lord.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TORAH_VERSE_4;A silence fills the room as the Rebbe clears his throat and begins to share some words of wisdom: \n	Rabbi Shelomo of Karlin once said: “When he, who has done all the commandments of the Torah, but has not felt the blaze of holy ecstasy in so doing, comes to that other world, they open the gates of paradise for him. But because he has not felt the blaze of ecstasy in this world, he does not feel the ecstasy of paradise. Now, if he is a fool, and complains, and grumbles: ‘And they make so much to-do about paradise!’ he is instantly thrown out. But if he is wise, he leaves of his own accord, and goes to the tzaddik, and he teaches the poor soul how to feel ecstasy.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
