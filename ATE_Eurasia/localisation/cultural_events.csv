EVTDESC_germany_reunited;The Ancient Empire of the German Peoples, long since broken by the Event has once more returned to this world a phoenix. Said to have first been forged upon the break up of Charlemagne's Empire by his descendant Otto the first of the Germans. Otto's Empire and its successors remained a great fixture in European Politics for Millenia, only succumbing to the overwhelming circumstances wrought by The Event when this empire was at its lowest. With the election of the New Kaiser underway, many noble courts across Europe are preparing to meet the new challenges presented by the re-emergence of this Ancient State.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_north_germany_reunited;Upon the corpse of Europa, the Lords of the Rhine, Ossi, and Lower Saxony cast their secret ballots in secession of the dream of Concordia and Saint Kierkegaard. Below the ancient Gates of the Kaisers the Lords elect from among themselves a pretender emperor to the one in Brussels. Parades can be seen from Cologne to Berlin as people push away the suffocating rot of Europa to embrace new avenues of enlightenment, whether that be the word of Christ or another. The Lively Court of Berlin embracing the feeling of a "Confederation of Brothers" not by some ancient dogma but one born from the realities of now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

True to their faith in the Lord's Light they gather in Frankfurt to proclaim from among them an emperor to rival Brussels. Festivals can be seen from Alsace to Vienna as people march in "Brotherly Love". The Lively Court of Frankfurt embracing this union as the flaming sword to free their cousins in the North from the rot infested Europa.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
